         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>To this Indictment, Sir <hi>Creſwel Levins,</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant <hi>Maynard,</hi> and the <hi>Attorney General</hi> briefly ſpoke. The <hi>Attorney General</hi> giving this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count why they choſe firſt to bring this Man to trial, That it was to convince thoſe who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all Deſigns againſt the King's Perſon by any Papiſt was but a Fiction; this Man being a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, and having ſaid theſe words even ſince the diſcovery of the Plot.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:152694:9"/>
               <p>And for the proof hereof, then appeared <hi>William Caſters,</hi> who depoſed, That on the 14th Inſtant, about 11 a Clock in the Day, he ſaw <hi>Stayley</hi> with another, a Frenchman, in a Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-houſe, who called for a Pot of Ale, and a Slice of Roaſt-Beef; which when it was called for, his Landlord ſaid it ſhould be brought him. He was in another Room oppoſite to him, both the Doors being open, <hi>Stayley</hi> ſtanding at one Door, and he at the other, his Face ſtrait to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and within 7 or 8 foot of him; and diſcourſing with the <hi>French</hi>-man, he heard <hi>Stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> twice over, in <hi>French</hi> ſay, <hi>The King was a Grand Heretick,</hi> making his Demonſtration, with his Hand upon his Breaſt, ſtamping five or ſix times with his Foot, in great fury.—That the old Man <hi>Fromante,</hi> his Friend, ſaid, That <hi>the King of</hi> England <hi>was a Tormenter of the People of God;</hi> and that <hi>Stayley</hi> anſwered again in a great fury, <hi>He is a great Heretick, and the greateſt Rogue in the World: There's the Heart, and here's the Hand that would kill him: And the King and Parliament think all is over, but the Rogues are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken:</hi> Then ſtamping ſaid, <hi>I would kill him my ſelf, I would kill him my ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Alexander Southerland</hi> depoſed that he alſo was there, and perfectly ſaw <hi>Stayley</hi> while he Apoke thoſe words, which preſently he writ down in French, as they were ſpoken: And then (the Priſoner being gone) they enquired his Name, and where he live; and the next day got him apprehended.</p>
               <p>The third Witneſ was one <hi>Philip Garret,</hi> who not underſtanding French, could only depoſe,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152694:9"/>That being with the other two, he heard <hi>Stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> ſpeak: Whereupon his Captain, <hi>William Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> cam to him in a great paſſion, and ſaid, he could not ſuffer it, he would run upon him, he could not be quiet.</p>
               <p>To all which the Priſoner made but a weak Defence, relating the manner of his Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſaying, That his diſcourſe with <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante</hi> was about the King of <hi>France;</hi> and that he ſaid, <hi>he would kill himſelf,</hi> inſtead of, <hi>I will kill him my ſelf;</hi> alleadging his Loyalty, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting his Innocence; and how that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, after his apprehenſion, would have had him took it up.</p>
               <p>Then the Statue of <hi>Decimo tertio</hi> was read; and Sir <hi>John Kirke</hi> one of the Jury, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood French, atteſted, that Tranſlation of his words to be true.</p>
               <p>Then the Priſoner's Witneſſes were called, who were one <hi>Anſelm,</hi> the Maſter of the Croſs-Keys in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> where the Priſoner was brought when he was apprenhended; who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, That they kept him in his Houſe from 8 till 11, without any Conſtable. —Which the Witneſſes anſwered was, becauſe they could get no Conſtable to come along with them, without a Warrant from a Juſtice of Peace; and that they ſent to <hi>White-hall</hi> and deſired a Guard, but the Officer ſaid it was the Conſtables part.</p>
               <p>Another Witneſs appeared for the Priſoner, who teſtified, that he had often heard him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare much Loyalty to his Prince, and an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Jeſuits, inſomuch that if he knew any of the Perſons concerned in this Plot, he would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152694:10"/>be their Executioner himſelf; and that he would loſe his Blood for the King.—But the <hi>Ld. Ch. Juſtice</hi> reply'd, That was his diſcourſe only when he ſpoke to a Proteſtant.</p>
               <p>Then the Priſoner having no more Witneſſes, nor any thing more to ſay for himſelf, the <hi>Ld. Ch. Juſtice</hi> made a Speech to the Jury, ſetting forth the Treaſonableneſs of the Words, and the manner of ſpeaking them, and the plainneſs of the Proof, with great zeal againſt the Juſuits and their Tenants, (whom he look'd upon as the Foundations of all this Miſchief) excuſing his warmneſs; ſaying, 'Twas <hi>better to be warm here than in</hi> Smithfield; and that <hi>he hoped he ſhould never go to that Heaven, where Men are made Saints for killing Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Jury then preſently brought the Priſoner in <hi>Guilty;</hi> who ſaid, he had nothing more to ſay; ſo Sentence was pronounced againſt him, to be <hi>Hang'd, Drawn, and Quartered;</hi> and the ſame was accordingly executed upon him at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> on <hi>Tueſday</hi> following, being <hi>Novemb.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>It was his Majeſty's pleaſure (becauſe of the Priſoner's ſeeming Penitence, and his Relations humble Petition) to ſuffer his Body to have a decent &amp; private Burial: But his Friends abuſing this gracious Favour, with a publick and more than ordinary Funeral Pomp, his buried Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were ordered to be taken up, and to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Common Executioner upon the Gates of the City.</p>

               <p>His Indictment was, for endeavouring to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and introduce <hi>Popery,</hi> and kill the King; Whereto (he having pleaded <hi>Not Guilty</hi>) <hi>Mr. Recorder, Serjeant Maynard,</hi> and then the <hi>Attorney General</hi> ſeverally ſpoke, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nature, and ſhewing the heighnouſneſs of the Crimes therein charg'd upon the Priſoner. After which the Priſoner praying for a favorable Trial, and profeſſing that he had confeſſed all the Truth in the Examinations that had been made of him in Priſon, and that he gave over his Correſponding beyond-Seas in 75.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was called forth, who depoſed, That in <hi>November</hi> laſt, he viſiting one <hi>John Keins</hi> his Father Confeſſor, lodging at Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Stable-Yard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> by him underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was going to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> told him,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152694:11"/>That he would trouble him with a Letter or two thither, and would leave them with one <hi>Fenwick</hi> (Procurator for the Jeſuits in <hi>London</hi>): Which Letters he carried to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> being directed for the Rector there, and was at the opening of them. The out-ſide Sheet was a Letter of News, and in it Expreſſions of the King, calling him <hi>Tyrant;</hi> and that the Marriage between the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> would prove the Traytor's and Tyrant's Ruin. In it was a Latin Letter to Father <hi>Le-Cheſe,</hi> (writ by the ſame Hand) giving him thanks for the 10000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> which was given for the Propagation of the Catholick Religion; and that it ſhould be imployed for no other Intent and Purpoſe but for that which it was ſent, which was, to <hi>cut off the King;</hi> which <hi>Le Cheſe</hi>'s Letter (dated in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> and which he both ſaw and read, and to which this was an Anſwer) poſitively expreſs'd. That Letter was directed to one <hi>Strange,</hi> then Provincial of the Society in <hi>London,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> anſwered, becauſe <hi>Strange</hi> having run a Reed into his Finger, had wounded his Hand, and Secretary <hi>Mico</hi> was ill. This Letter he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into <hi>Le-Cheſe</hi>'s own Hand, who gave him a Letter in anſwer to it, which he brought to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and was there incloſed in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Society to <hi>Coleman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He further depoſed, that in <hi>April</hi> laſt Old Stile, and <hi>May</hi> New Stile, there was a general Conſult of the Jeſuits held (by virtue of a Brief from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſent by the Father General of the Society) firſt at the. <hi>White-Horſe</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and afterwards in ſeveral Clubs,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152694:11"/>wherein the Death of the King was Conſpired, <hi>Grove</hi> and <hi>Pickering</hi> being imployed to Piſtol him in St. <hi>Jame's Park;</hi> for which <hi>Grove</hi> was to have 1500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> in Mony, and <hi>Pickering</hi> (being a Prieſt) was to have 30000 Maſſes, which at twelve Pence a Maſs amounted much-what to that Mony; to all which <hi>Coleman</hi> was privy, and in one Letter he writ about it, expreſs'd his diſire to have the Duke trappan'd into this Plot to murther the King.</p>
               <p>And in caſe this fail'd, there was a further Deſign lay'd to murther the King at <hi>Windſor</hi> by four Iriſh Aſſaſſinates, provided by Dr. <hi>Fogarthy;</hi> and fourſcore Pounds were provided by Father <hi>Harcourt</hi> (a Jeſuit, and Rector of <hi>London</hi>) for their preſent Maintainance; which <hi>Coleman</hi> ſaw upon a Table in <hi>Wild-Houſe</hi> where he was with <hi>Harcourt,</hi> and gave the Meſſenger, who was there ready to carry them after the Ruffians to <hi>Windſor,</hi> a Guiny for expedition, ſaying <hi>he lik'd it very well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, and if this alſo ſhould fail, there were Inſtructions brought by one <hi>Aſhby</hi> (a Jeſuit) in <hi>July</hi> laſt to <hi>London</hi> from <hi>Flanders,</hi> to proffer 10000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> to Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> to Poiſon the King; Which Inſtructions were ſeen and read by Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> by him copied out and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſeveral Conſpirators of the King's Death in this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> that were privy to this Plot. He ſaid 10000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> was too little, and therefore he procured 5000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> more to be added to it; which Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> accepted of, and receiv'd 5000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> in hand, with a promiſe of the Reſt as ſoon as he ſhould have done the Work.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:152694:12"/>
               <p>He depoſed likewiſe, that a Conſult had been held in the <hi>Savoy</hi> with the Jeſuits &amp; Benedictine Monks, for the murthering of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and raiſing a Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> (the Pope's Right to that Kingdom being aſſerted) and 40000 black Bills provided to be ſent thither for the uſe of the Catholick Party; <hi>Coleman</hi> being privy thereto, and the main Agent therein, being heard to ſay to <hi>Fenwick,</hi> that he had found a way to tranſmit the 200000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> for the carrying on this Rebellion in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he ſaw likewiſe, ſeveral Commiſſions come from <hi>Rome</hi> in Mr. <hi>Langhorn's</hi> Chamber, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which was one for Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> to be Secretary of State; the receipt of which he hath ſince heard him acknowledg.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner then offer'd ſomething againſt the Informant; from his telling the King, when he was examin'd before the Council, that he never ſaw him before; Which the Informant obviated, by confeſſing, that there and then he did ſay that he would not ſwear that he had ſeen him before, his Sight being bad by Candle-light, and being then wearied and tired out, but that when he had heard him ſpeak he could have ſworn it was he, but it was not then his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>The other Witneſs then produced againſt the Priſoner was Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> Who depoſed that he heard Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourn</hi> ſay, that he had a Commiſſion, and that he brought one for Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> (and the reſt of the Lords; from the Principal of the Jeſuits at <hi>Rome,</hi> by order of the Pope) to be Principal Secretary of State. And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152694:12"/>that he was imployed by <hi>Harcourt</hi> to carry Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>Le-Cheſe</hi> (the French King's Confeſſor) and was at a Conſult in <hi>France,</hi> where the Plot was diſcourſed on for killing the King, and did bring back an Anſwer from <hi>Le-Cheſe</hi> to <hi>Harcourt</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and on the 24th or 25th of <hi>May,</hi> 1677. he was with <hi>Harcourt</hi> at <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Houſe, where he heard <hi>Coleman</hi> ſpeak theſe words, That <hi>if he had a Sea of Blood, and an hundred Lives, he would loſe them all to carry on the Deſign: And if to effect this, it were neceſſary to deſtroy an hundred Heretick Kings, he would do it.</hi> The Priſoner then asking Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> if he ever ſaw him in his life: He anſwer'd; <hi>You may ask that queſtion: But in the ſtone Gallery in Somerſet-Houſe, when you came from a Conſult where were great Perſons, which I am not to name here, that would make the bottom of your Plot tremble: You ſaw me then.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Court then proceeded to other evidence, which were the Priſoners Papers; and proved the manner of finding them by Mr. <hi>Bradley</hi> (a Meſſenger) and that thoſe, which were then produced in the Court, were his, by the Clerks of the Council, and his own Servant; Ordering them afterwards to be read.</p>
               <p>The firſt Paper was a long Letter, dated <hi>Sept.</hi> 29. 1675, ſent to <hi>Le-Cheſe;</hi> wherein he gives him an account of the Tranſactions of ſeveral Years before, and of the Correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Monſieur <hi>Ferrier,</hi> Predeceſſor to <hi>Le-Cheſe;</hi> Aſſerting, that the true way to carry on the Intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> and the promoting of <hi>Popery</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> was to get that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſſolved; which (ſays he) had been long
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152694:13"/>ſince effected, if 300000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> could have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the <hi>French</hi> King. And that things yet were in ſuch a poſture, that if he had but 20000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> ſent him from <hi>France,</hi> he would be content to be a Sacrifice to the utmoſt Malice of his Enemies, if the Proteſtant Religion did not receive ſuch a Blow as it could not ſubſiſt.</p>
               <p>The receipt of this Letter was acknowledged by <hi>Le-Cheſe,</hi> in an Anſwer he wrote to Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> (and was then read in the Court) dated from <hi>Paris, October</hi> 23. 1675. wherein he gives him thanks for his good Service, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes his Aſſiſtance, in order to the promoting the Popiſh Religion.</p>
               <p>Then was produced and read, <hi>a Declaration</hi> which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> (as Secretary) had penned in the King's Name, ſhewing his Reaſons for the Diſſolution of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Then alſo was read a Copy of a Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Le-Cheſe,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> confeſſed he himſelf wrote, and counterfeited in the Duke's Name; and that when he was ſo bold as to ſhew it to the Duke, the Duke was very angry and rejected it.</p>
               <p>Several other Letters were read of Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s to <hi>Monſieur Ferrier</hi> and others; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly one dated <hi>Auguſt</hi> 21. 1674. to the Pope's Internuncio at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> wherein he ſays, The Deſign proſpered ſo well, that he doubted not, but in a little time, the Buſineſs would be managed to the utter Ruin of the Proteſtant Party. And by other Letters he writes to the French King's Confeſſor, that the Aſſiſtance of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty is neceſſary, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152694:13"/>deſires Mony from him to carry on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
               <p>But there was one Letter without Date, more bloody than all the reſt, which was written to <hi>Le Cheſe,</hi> in ſome ſhort time after the long Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Sept.</hi> 29, 1675. wherein among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> expreſſes himſelf thus. <hi>We have a mighty Work upon our hands, no leſs than the Converſion of three Kingdoms, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſubduing of a Peſtilent Hereſy, which hath for ſome time domineer'd over this Northern Part of the World; and there never were ſuch hopes of ſucceſs ſince the Death of our Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>as now in our days.</hi> And in the Concluſion of this Letter he implores <hi>Le Cheſe</hi> to get all the Aid and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he can from <hi>France;</hi> and that next to God Almighty, he did rely upon the mighty Mind of his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did hope <hi>Le Cheſe</hi> would procure Mony and Aſſiſtance from him.</p>
               <p>Then Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> at the deſire of the Priſoner was call'd again, concerning the time of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult; <hi>Coleman</hi> offering to prove that he was the moſt part of that Month in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething to excuſe himſelf from the Guilt of Treaſon; but being clearly convic'd in both Points, Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> (his Majeſty's Solitcior General) ſum'd up the Evidence; to which Serjeant <hi>Pemberton</hi> added ſomething; and then the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> ſpoke to the Jury, who preſently brought the Priſoner in <hi>Guilty;</hi> who on the Morrow Morning being brought to the Bar, offered again ſomething as to his being out of Town, and pleaded the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152694:14"/>King's Act of Grace, the inſufficiency of which, as to him, being ſhewn, the Ld. Ch. Juſtice di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a very excellent and Chriſtian Speech to him, pronouncing Sentence upon him, to be hang'd, drawn and quartered. And on <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Decemb.</hi> 3. following, he was accordingly drawn on a Sledg from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> where he declared, that he had been a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> for many Years, and that he thanked God he died in that Religion: and he ſaid he did not think that Religion at all prejudicial to the King and Government.</p>
               <p>The Sheriff told him, if he had any thing to ſay by way of Confeſſion or Contrition he might proceed, otherwiſe it was not ſeaſonable for him to go on with ſuch like Expreſſions. And being asked if he knew any thing of the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> he declared upon the words of a dying Man, he knew not any thing of it; for that he was a Priſoner at that time.</p>
               <p>Then after ſome private Prayers and Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to himſelf, the Sentence was executed upon him.</p>

That <hi>Fenwick</hi> was by when the 80 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> was ſent by <hi>Harcourt</hi> to <hi>VVindſor</hi> for the four <hi>Ruffians:</hi> That he received the <hi>Oath</hi> of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy which <hi>VVhitebread</hi> adminiſtred upon a Maſs-Book, <hi>Mico</hi> holding the Candle. That <hi>VVhitebread</hi> iſſued out ſeveral Commiſſions, and particularly one for Sir <hi>John Gage</hi> of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> which the Witneſs ſaw, to be an Officer in the Army. That in <hi>Auguſt</hi> there was a Conſult,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152694:16"/>whereat <hi>Fenwick</hi> was, wherein there was a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign laid for killing the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and raiſing a Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to which <hi>VVhite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread</hi> alſo conſented when he came over, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their Entry-Books. That in <hi>September VVhitebread</hi> having had Intimation from one <hi>Beddingfield</hi> of the Plots being diſcover'd, and of the ſuſpicion they had of the Witneſs; being waited upon at his Lodgings upon his coming over by the Witneſs, he beat, affronted, and reviled the ſaid Witneſs, commanding him to go beyond Sea again, aſſaulting him in his Lodging afterwards to have murthered him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jealous that he had betrayed them.</p>
               <p>He depoſed alſo that <hi>Grove</hi> did go about with one <hi>Smith</hi> to gather <hi>Peter-Pence,</hi> and that he ſaw the Book wherein it was entred. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to him, that he with three <hi>Iriſh</hi> Men did fire <hi>Southwark,</hi> for which <hi>Grove</hi> had 400 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and the other three 200 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> a piece.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> depoſed, That he had been five Years almoſt employed by the Jeſuits and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monks in <hi>Paris,</hi> to carry and bring Letters between them from and to <hi>England</hi> for the promoting of this Plot; Relating how <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> began to employ him, and naming the particular places whither he had been ſent, to ſhew the Reaſons of his knowledg in this matter, ſaying, that in all their Conſults wherein he was, it was always concluded on, <hi>That they would not leave any Member of any Heretick in</hi> England, <hi>that ſhould ſurvive to tell in the Kingdom hereafter, that there ever was any ſuch Religion in</hi> England <hi>as the Proteſtant Religion.</hi> Then he proceeded to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152694:16"/>depoſe that in <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt there was a Conſult at <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Chamber, about killing the King (as <hi>Pritchard</hi> inform'd him) and of ſending the four Ruffians to <hi>Windſor,</hi> who failing, it was afterwards concluded <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> ſhould go on, and <hi>Conyers</hi> be joyned with them to aſſaſſinate the King in his Morning-Walks at <hi>New-Market;</hi> this he heard in <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in <hi>Auguſt</hi> alſo; <hi>Grove,</hi> and <hi>Pickering,</hi> and <hi>Pritchard,</hi> and <hi>Fogarthy,</hi> and <hi>Harcourt,</hi> and the Witneſs being preſent. And <hi>Grove</hi> being more forward than the reſt, ſaid, <hi>Since it could not be done clandeſtinely, it ſhould be attempted openly. That thoſe that fell, had the Glory to die in a good Cauſe. But if it were diſcovered, the Diſcovery could never come to the heighth, but their Party would be ſtrong enough to bring it to paſs.</hi> That <hi>Grove</hi> was to have 1500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and <hi>Pickering</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of Maſſes. That there was a Diſcourſe at the ſame time of a deſign to kill ſeveral Noble Perſons: <hi>Knight</hi> was to kill the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury; Pritchard</hi> the Duke of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham, Oneile</hi> the Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> and <hi>Obrian</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ormond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then a Letter was produced and read in Court (ſworn by Sir <hi>Thomas Doleman</hi> to have been found among <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Papers, four or five days after Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> had given in his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations) from one <hi>Edward Petre,</hi> giving ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count when the Conſult was to be, as ordered by their Provincial <hi>Whitebread,</hi> mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence as to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:152694:17"/>
               <p>Then the Seals alſo were ſhewn in Court that were made uſe of to ſign Commiſſions, taken out of <hi>VVhitebread</hi>'s Chamber.</p>
               <p>Then the King's Counſel here ending their Evidence, the Lord Chief Juſtice took notice to the Jury, that there had only one Witneſs ſworn againſt <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Fenwick; Bedloe</hi> charging them with nothing of his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; and that therefore he would diſcharge them of them, and accordingly he ſent them back to the Goal. And the other three were called upon to make their Defence, which was only a bare denial of the Matter of Fact. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Ireland</hi> being charged in <hi>Auguſt</hi> laboured very much to prove that he was out of Town all that Month, by the Teſtimony of his Mother, and Siſter, and one <hi>Harriſon</hi> (Sir <hi>John South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cott</hi>'s Coachman) and one <hi>Gifford.</hi> His Mother and Siſter ſaying expreſly that he went out of Town <hi>Auguſt</hi> 3d, and <hi>Harriſon</hi> that he ſaw him at St. <hi>Albans Auguſt</hi> 5th, and continued in his Company to the 16th, and <hi>Gifford</hi> that he ſaw him at the latter end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and beginning of <hi>September</hi> at <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> tho it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by very good Circumſtances, and upon Oath for the King, by <hi>Sarah Pain</hi> (Servant to <hi>Grove</hi>) that ſhe ſaw him at his own door in <hi>London</hi> about the 12th or 13th of the ſame Month. His next Defence was a weak Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Credit, to which purpoſe an Indictment for Perjury never proſecuted, was urged againſt him, but the Attourny-General made ſlight of it, as of a thing that had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it. Neither was that which Sir <hi>Dennis
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152694:17"/>Aſhbournham</hi> ſaid of greater force, concerning the Irregularities of his Childhood, which he ſaid would have ſtaggered his Belief of what the Doctor had depoſed if the matter had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended ſolely upon his Teſtimony, but being ſo corroborated with other Circumſtances, he was convinced of the Truth of what he had diſcovered; nor did he think any thing could be ſaid againſt Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> to take off his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice then ſumm'd up the Evidence, ſmartly inveighing againſt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Doctrines of Popery. After which the Jury retired for a very little while, and then brought thoſe three Priſoners in <hi>Guilty.</hi> And then the Court Adjourn'd till the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, when being met about five a Clock Mr. <hi>Recorder</hi> (the Judges being gone home) made an excellent Speech againſt Popery, to the Priſoners, ſentencing them to be <hi>drawn hang'd and quartered;</hi> which accordingly was executed upon them at <hi>Tyburn</hi> on Friday, <hi>Jan.</hi> 24th following.</p>

               <p>Then Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> being ſworn, depoſed, That in <hi>September</hi> Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> in Diſcourſe did tell him what Affronts he had received from ſome great Perſons for being ſo zealous to take Examinations concerning the Plot: And that others who were well inclin'd to have the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very made, did think that he had not been quick enough in the Proſecution, but had been too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, and did threaten him that they would complain to the Parliament, which was to ſit the 21ſt of <hi>October</hi> following. That about a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152694:18"/>week before he was miſſing; he came to the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a great fright, and told him that ſeveral Popiſh Lords had threatned him, and asked him what he had to do with it? He ſaid he went in fear of his Life by the Papiſts, and that he had been dog'd ſeveral days.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Thomas Robinſon</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> chief Prothono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Court of Court of Common-Pleas, and a Juſtice of the Peace for <hi>Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> did depoſe that diſcourſing Sir <hi>Edmondbury</hi> about the Examinations he had taken about his Plot, he ſaid to him, that he ſhould have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Thanks for his Pains, that he did it very unwillingly, and would fain have had it done by others. And that <hi>he did believe, upon his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he ſhould be the firſt Martyr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> depoſed, that about two or three Weeks before Sir <hi>Edmondbury</hi>'s Murder; He, <hi>Girald, Green,</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> met ſeveral times at the <hi>Plow</hi> Ale-Houſe by the Water-ſide; where <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> inticed the Witneſs, ſaying, Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> was a buſie Man, and had done, and would do a great deal of Miſchief, and it was a piece of Charity and no Sin to kill him. That they had dog'd him into <hi>Red-Lion</hi> Fields, but had not an opportunity to kill him. That <hi>Hill, Girald,</hi> and <hi>Green,</hi> had dog'd him all <hi>Saturday, October</hi> 12. laſt, from his firſt going out (<hi>Hill</hi> having firſt ſpoke with him upon ſome pretended ſtory at his own Houſe) whereof <hi>Kelly</hi> gave the Witneſs notice; at night they lodg'd him in a Houſe at St. <hi>Clements,</hi> and about ſeven a Clock <hi>Green</hi> call'd the Witneſs out of his own Houſe in <hi>Princes-ſtreet</hi> to <hi>Semerſet-Houſe;</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:152694:19"/>that about eight or nine a Clock <hi>Hill</hi> came before up the ſtreet, and gave them notice to be ready, and then ſtay'd at the Gate till Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey</hi> came by, and then told him, there were two Men a quarrelling, and deſired him to come and try whether he could pacify them; he was very unwilling; but being intreated, he went down till he came to the bottom of the Rails, and then <hi>Green</hi> twiſted his Handkerchief, and threw it about his Neck, and threw him behind the Rails, and there throtled him, and punched him, and <hi>Girald</hi> (a Prieſt, as alſo was <hi>Kelly</hi>) would have thruſt his Sword through him, but the reſt would not permit him, for fear it ſhould diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them by the Blood. That about a quarter of an Hour after the Witneſs came down, and found he was not quite dead; and then <hi>Green</hi> wrung his Neck quite round; that he watch'd the Water-Gate, and <hi>Berry</hi> the Stairs while the Murder was a doing, but theſe Circumſtances they all told him afterwards. That when he came to them, there was <hi>Hill, Green, Girald,</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> about the Body, and <hi>Berry</hi> came to them from the Stairs, and they ſix help'd to carry the Body into <hi>Hill</hi>'s Chamber in Dr. <hi>Godwin</hi>'s Houſe, where it lay till <hi>Monday</hi> night, ſomething being thrown over it, and then it was removed into <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> ſhew'd it him with a Dark-Lanthorn, <hi>Girald, Hill,</hi> and <hi>Kelly,</hi> being then in the Room. On <hi>Tueſday</hi> Night it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved back again towards <hi>Hill</hi>'s Chamber, but ſomebody being there, they lay'd it in a Room juſt over againſt, ſuppoſed to belong to Sir <hi>John Arundel</hi>'s Lodgings. There it lay till <hi>Wedneſday</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:152694:19"/>Night about nine a Clock, when they removed it into the Room where it firſt lay; and the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs coming juſt as they were removing it, they were affrighted and run away; but he ſpeaking, <hi>Berry</hi> came back again, and got the Body up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Room, and about twelve a Clock they carried it away in a Sedan which <hi>Hill</hi> brought; that the Witneſs and <hi>Girald</hi> carry'd the Sedan; <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> going before, and <hi>Berry</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gate at an Hem: that they carry'd him into <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and then <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> to <hi>Long-Acre,</hi> and then they again to <hi>Soe-hoe</hi> Church, where <hi>Hill</hi> met them with an Horſe, on which they ſet the Body aſtride, forcing open his Legs, and <hi>Hill</hi> held him up, and ſo (leaving the Sedan in one of the new Houſes there till they came back again) <hi>Green, Hill, Girald</hi> and <hi>Kelly,</hi> went away with him; and (as they told the Witneſs next morning) they, having run him through with his own Sword, threw him into a Ditch, and laid his Gloves and other things upon the Bank, — That <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat</hi> did ſpeak of a great Reward to be given for this, from the Lord <hi>Bellaſis:</hi> — That <hi>Girald</hi> was reſolved to kill him that Night; and if he could not otherwiſe, he would kill him with his own Sword in the Street that leads to his own Houſe.—That afterwards, He, and <hi>Girald,</hi> and <hi>Vernat,</hi> and one <hi>Luſon,</hi> Prieſts, did dine at one <hi>Caſshes,</hi> at the <hi>Queens-Head</hi> at <hi>Bow,</hi> having a Barrel of Oyſters, and a diſh of Fiſh, which he bought himſelf: That Mr. <hi>Vernat</hi> ſent a Note by a Cobler for one Mr. <hi>Dethick,</hi> who preſently came to them, and then they all read the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152694:20"/>of the Murder, and were very merry; but the Witneſs hearing the Door a little ruſtle, went and catch'd a Drawer liſtning, whom he told he could find in his Heart to kick down Stairs, and ſo ſent him away.—That this <hi>Vernat</hi> was to have been one at the Murder; but ſomething happen'd he could not.—That this Witneſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> depoſed, That in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>October</hi> laſt, he was ſeveral times treated with, by <hi>Le Faire, Prichard, Kains,</hi> and ſeveral other Prieſts, about murthering of a Gentleman (refuſing to tell him who it was) promiſing 4000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and ſome to aſſiſt him in it. Afterwards that he was commanded by them to inſinuate himſelf into the Acquaintance of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> which he did by pretending to come for Warrants for the good Behaviour. —That the day before he was murder'd, he ſent his Boy to Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey</hi> to invite him to the Tavern, where were <hi>Prichard, Le Faire, Welch, Kaines,</hi> &amp; another (5 Jeſuits) that they alſo might have inſinuated themſelves into his Acquaintance, but he was not at home.—That the next day <hi>Le Faire</hi> told him that there was a conſiderable Gentleman to be put out of the way that night, who had all the Informations of Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> and if he ſhould not be put out of the way, and thoſe Papers took from him, the Buſineſs would be ſo obſtructed, that they would not be able to effect it till another Age. The Witneſs then told him, that according to his Promiſe he would aſſiſt; and was appointed to meet him that Night in the <hi>Cloyſters</hi> at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe.</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:152694:20"/>And asking where the Reward was? <hi>Le Faire</hi> told him, that no worſe a Man was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for it than the Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had order to pay it:— That the Witneſs ſeeing <hi>Le Faire</hi> again on Monday night, he was charged by him with his breach of Promiſe; but excuſed it, by his being otherwiſe engaged, and becauſe he would not murther a Man, till he knew who he was; whereupon <hi>Le Faire</hi> ſaid he would tell him more, if he would meet him that night at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> at nine a Clock; accordingly he did, and walk'd and talk'd in the Cloyſters a great while with him. And then <hi>Le Faire</hi> told him he had done ill, not to help in this Buſineſs, but if he would help to carry the Body off, he ſhould have half the Reward: Whereupon underſtanding the Murder was done, he asked to ſee the Body; and ſo was brought into the Room where were a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and upon viewing the body, knew who it was; and was there told they deſigned to put the Murder upon himſelf, and would carry him out in a Chair, and <hi>Berry</hi> was to ſit up to let them out. Then they preſs'd the Witneſs to help to carry him out, but he excuſed himſelf, ſaying, it was too early, but about eleven or twelve a Clock it would be a better time, and then he would come again. Then ſaid <hi>Le Faire</hi> to him, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Sacrament you took on Thurſday, you will be at the carrying off of this Man at Night:</hi> he promiſed him he would, and away he came very much unſatisfied in himſelf, having ſo great a charge upon him, as the Sacrament of the Altar; which, after the Diſcovery of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:152694:21"/>Plot, was adminiſtred to him twice a-week to conceal it. Afterwards he went to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and being reſtleſs, reſolv'd upon a Diſcovery, and ſo writ to the Secretary of it, and went to the Parliament, and gave in his Information, that then in the Lobby he diſcover'd Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> having never ſeen him but that Night when he view'd the Body. — And that the Body was not carryed off that Night becauſe he came not, but was removed and kept longer, for feat of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
               <p>For corroborating of theſe Evidences, Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> the Conſtable was then ſworn, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that he found the Body in a Ditch with a Sword (which his Servants ſaid was his own) run through him, and the end of it was two handfuls out of him. — That there was no Blood to be ſeen any where: — That the Sword had been run into him in another place, which being againſt a Rib could not go through him, but that there was no Blood there: — That he look'd black about the Breſt: — That he ſuppoſed his Neck had been broken, becauſe it was very weak and his Head might be turned from one Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to another:—That his Stick and Gloves were on the Bank-ſide, and he had a great deal of Gold and Silver in his Pocket.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Skillard</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cambridg,</hi> who were Chirurgeons that view'd and ſearch'd his Body, being ſworn, both depoſed to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; That they found his Neck diſſocated, and his Breaſt very much beaten and bruiſed, and two Punctures under his left Pap, the one went againſt a Rib, the other quite through the Body,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152694:21"/>both which they believed was given him after his Death, and that he did not die of thoſe Wounds; That he had been kill'd four or five Days, for that he began to putrify and ſmell when they opened him, which was the next day after he was found.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Elizabeth Curtis,</hi> Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey</hi>'s Maid depoſed, that ſhe had ſeen <hi>Green</hi> at her Maſter's Houſe, about a Fortnight before his Murder, and <hi>Hill</hi> that very <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning, making it out by good Circumſtances. <hi>Lancelot Stringer</hi> (a Servant at the <hi>Plow-Alehouſe</hi>) depoſed, that he had ſeen <hi>Girald,</hi> all <hi>Hill,</hi> and <hi>Kelly,</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,</hi> and <hi>Green</hi> in Mr. <hi>Prance</hi>'s Company at their Houſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Vincent,</hi> the Maſter of the Houſe, ſwore the ſame, as to all thoſe Perſons; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming Mr. <hi>Prance</hi>'s Evidence as to that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, the Court proceeded to do the ſame as to what related to their meeting at <hi>Bow.</hi> And therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard Cary</hi> being call'd, depoſed, that he carried the Letter to Mr. <hi>Dethicke,</hi> which he gave into his own Hands, he telling him he would be with the Gentlemen preſently; and when he returned and told them ſo, they gave him a Glaſs of Claret and ſix pence; — That he thought Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> (looking upon him) to be one of the Gentlemen; and Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him to be the Meſſenger.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>William Evens,</hi> the Boy of the Houſe at the <hi>Queens-Head,</hi> depoſed that he remembred the Company that was at his Maſters Houſe two or three Months ago, to whom Mr. <hi>Dethick</hi> came
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152694:22"/>(whom he knew very well) and that they read a Paper, and named Sir <hi>Edam. Godfrey</hi>'s Name; and while he was at the door, ſome body came and threatned to kick him down Stairs;—That they dined there, and had a Barrel of Oyſters, and Flounders which one of them bought.</p>
               <p>After this Sir <hi>Robert Southwel</hi> being called and ſworn, depoſed that when Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before the King, <hi>Dec.</hi> 24. he was ſent with the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the E. of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vice Chamberlain</hi> to the Queen, and himſelf to <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> where he ſhewed them all the Places where all was done, exactly anſwerable to what he had declared to the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil before, only he was at a loſs, and could not be poſitive, which was the Room wherein he had ſeen the Body on Monday Night by Candle-Light; — He depoſed alſo that <hi>Hill</hi> in his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination at the Council-Board denyed that he knew <hi>Kelly,</hi> but that he knew <hi>Girald.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Thomas Stringer</hi> depoſed, that <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> upon his Examination before the Lords of the Committee, did ſay, he had Orders from the Queen's Gentleman-Uſher, that he ſhould ſuffer no Strangers, nor any Perſon of Quality to come into <hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi> the 12th, 13th, and 14th of <hi>October,</hi> and that he did refuſe the Prince, but ſent him back again: and that he never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had any ſuch Directions.</p>
               <p>In Anſwer to theſe Facts, thus made out, <hi>Hill</hi> defended himſelf, by affirming that Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> had perjur'd himſelf, by denying or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canting what he had ſworn before the King; but that was over-ruled by the Court, for that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:152694:22"/>Mr. <hi>Prance</hi>'s firſt Impeachment was upon Oath, and his Recantation but only a bare Denial. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that Capt. <hi>Richardſon</hi> depoſed, that Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> did retract his Recantation by that time he had brought him back to his Houſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his Pardon; ſaying, it was only fear that made him recant, leſt his Trade ſhould be loſt, and he be in danger of being murdered by the Papiſts; but that what he had ſworn was true, and his Recantation falſe; — <hi>Hill</hi> produced moreover, <hi>Mary Tilden</hi> (Dr. <hi>Godwin</hi>'s Neece and Houſe-Keeper) and one Mrs. <hi>Broadſtreet,</hi> to prove that he ſtirr'd not from home after eight a Clock that Night: the ſame atteſted <hi>Katherine Lee, Daniel Gray, Robert How, Thomas Cutler, Richard Lazinby,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Achbold;</hi>—He further urged that Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> had been tortured, to make him confeſs what he did; and that there were ſeveral about the Court that heard him cry out. But Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> upon his Oath, utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd and ſuch thing, affirming that the Keeper had uſed him with all Civility from his firſt Commitment. — <hi>Hill</hi>'s Wife offered alſo a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Court, containing Obſervations upon the Indictment, which ſhe deſired might be read, but it was refuſed, and ſhe bid to give it her Husband.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Green</hi> produced for his Defence, the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>James Warrier</hi> his Landlord, and his Wife and Maid, which being found to relate to <hi>October</hi> 19. was deemed nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Berry</hi> produced Corporal <hi>William Collet,</hi> who affirmed that he on that Wedneſday Night pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Sentinels at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe, Nicholas
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152694:23"/>Trollop</hi> from ſeven to ten, who confeſſed that in his time a Sedan was brought in: <hi>Nicholas Right</hi> ſtood from ten to one, who ſaid no Sedan came out in his time; and <hi>Gabriel Hasket,</hi> who affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame for his time: And <hi>Eliz. Minſhaw, Berry</hi>'s Maid affirmed that her Maſter was in Bed that Night by twelve a Clock. — The Sentinels Evidence was only though material; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they could not be ſo poſitive but that they might be miſtaken, by reaſon of the darkneſs of the Night, and Privacy of the Conveyance, their Evidence was not thought ſubſtantial.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Attorney General</hi> then ſpoke to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currency of <hi>Prance</hi>'s and <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Evidences; and Mr. <hi>Solicitor General</hi> to the Conſiſtancy thereof. After which the <hi>Ld. Ch. Juſtice</hi> ſum'd up the Evidence, and directed the Jury, in a very tart Speech againſt the Cruelty of the Romiſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.— Then the Jury withdrawing for a ſhort ſpace, brought the Priſoners all in guilty. Upon which the <hi>Ld. Ch. Juſtice</hi> told them that they had found the ſame Verdict that he would have found if he had been one with them; and if it were the laſt word he were to ſpeak in this World, he ſhould have pronounced them guilty. At which Words the whole Aſſembly gave a great ſhout of Applauſe.</p>
               <p>The next day the Priſoners being brought again to the Bar, Mr. Juſtice <hi>Wyld,</hi> who as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Judg in that Court, pronounceth the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in all Criminal Matters (except High-Treaſon) ſpoke an excellent Speech to them, wherein he ſhewed them the Greatneſs of their Crime, and gave them good Advice; and then
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152694:23"/>ſentenc'd them to be <hi>Drawn, Hang'd</hi> and <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd;</hi> which was accordingly executed upon them at <hi>Tyburn</hi> on <hi>Fryday</hi> the 21ſt of <hi>Feb.</hi> they all denying the Fact to the laſt.</p>

               <p>TO whom an Information exhibited by the Kings <hi>Attorney General</hi> againſt the ſaid <hi>Thompſon, Pain</hi> and <hi>Farrel</hi> was read, for writing and printing ſeveral ſcandalous Libels about the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152694:24"/>Death of Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey,</hi> reflecting on the Juſtice of the Nation in the Proceedings againſt his Murtherers. Which Information Mr. <hi>Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> opened, and Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> aggravated the Crimes therein contained.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Clare</hi> then was ſworn, and produced a Copy of the Record of the Conviction and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder of Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey:</hi> As alſo a Copy of the Inquiſition take by the Coroner of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> upon the view of the Body of the ſaid Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey,</hi> whereby it was found by them that he was murthered, ſtrangled with a Cord by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons unknown. Both which (Mr. <hi>Clare</hi> having ſworn to be true Copies) were read. Then the Execution of <hi>Green, Berry</hi> and <hi>Hill</hi> was atteſted by the Oath of Capt. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> and <hi>Curtis</hi> ſwore that they and <hi>Bedloe</hi> were Witneſſes at their Tryals.</p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>John Nicholas,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd,</hi> and <hi>William Bridgman</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſwore that the two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Information (which were ſhewed them) were the ſame that were ſhewed to <hi>Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Pain</hi> and <hi>Farrel,</hi> at the Council; and that <hi>Thompſon</hi> owned the printing of both; and <hi>Farrel</hi> owned the bringing of the firſt, and <hi>Pain</hi> owned the bringing of the other to <hi>Thompſon:</hi> both which Letters was then read in the Court.</p>
               <p>The firſt (which <hi>Farrel</hi> owned he writ) was intitled, <hi>A Letter to Mr.</hi> Miles Prance, <hi>in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Murder of Sir</hi> Edm. Godfrey. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign whereof was to contradict the Evidence given at the Trial of his Murderers, and to fix the Guilt upon himſelf; affirming that the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152694:24"/>Inqueſt were firſt of Opinion he was <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> and there was much Art us'd to procure their Verdict to the contrary. That the Body was refuſed to be opened; and the Coroner of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>'s Aſſiſtance rejected, and he diſmiſt with a Guiny. That he was not dogg'd as was ſworn, but was ſeen in ſeveral places, and about three in the Afternoon about <hi>Primroſe-hill,</hi> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Fields. That he was found in a place inacceſſible by a Horſe, and in ſuch a poſture, as inferr'd he could never be thruſt into a Sedan. That his Body was full of Blood; and when the Sword was pulled out, Blood and Water ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much iſſued out of that Wound; and that part of the Sword which was in the Body was diſcoloured, and the Point which was through was ruſty; his Clothes, Belt, and Scabbord, were weather-beaten to Rags, his Body ſtunk, and his Eyes, Noſtrils, and Mouth, were Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blown; his Eyes ſhut, his Face pale; no Dirt on his Shoes, nor Horſe-hair on his Clothes; and that <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s and <hi>Prance</hi>'s Evidence before the Committee of Lords, very much differ'd. And that all this would be proved by divers credible and undeniable Eye and Ear-Witneſſes.—Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Cambridg, Feb.</hi> 23. 1681.—Subſcribed <hi>Truman. London,</hi> printed for <hi>M. G.</hi> at the Sign of Sir <hi>E. B. G</hi>'s Head, near <hi>Fleet-bridg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Letter (writ by <hi>Pain</hi>) was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>A ſecond Letter to Mr.</hi> Miles Prance, <hi>in Reply to the Ghoſt of Sir</hi> E. Godfrey. Which was a Vindication of the Firſt, in Reply to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer given thereto, by a Paper Intituled, <hi>The Ghoſt of Sir</hi> E. Godfrey; Diſclaiming the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:152694:25"/>of any Papiſts in publiſhing that Paper, aſſerting for Truth all that had been ſaid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which was ready to be proved by many Witneſſes, who were not willing to expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the fury of that Torrent, which then carried all before it in favour of the Plot, by appearing at the Trial; running over all the Paragraphs of the other Letter, aſſerting what had there been ſaid for Truth; endeavouring to wipe off the Objections given, in a ſcurrilous manner; imputing Melancholy to be predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey</hi>'s Family, and that ſuch Accidents were no News thereto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Dated from <hi>Cambridg, March</hi> 13. 1681. ſubſcribed <hi>Truman. London,</hi> Printed for <hi>Nath. Thompſon,</hi> 1682.</p>
               <p>Then was read a Paragraph out of <hi>N. Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s <hi>Loyal Proteſtant Intelligence,</hi> Numb. 125. <hi>Tueſday, March</hi> 7. 1681. which was a kind of Advertiſement of this ſecond Letter's coming out; and an Aſſertion, that all things in the firſt were true; and were ready, by undeniable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to be made out. Then a Paragraph was read out of another of the like <hi>Intelligences,</hi> Num. 127. <hi>Saturday, March</hi> 11. 1681. which was a kind of challenging an Anſwer to the firſt Letter; and of the City's inſpection of the Truth thereof, promiſing Proof to every Tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, without one Papiſt, or Popiſhly-Affected Perſon being concern'd therein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, by theſe Letters and Intelligences they endeavoured to ſtifle the Evidence of the King, and arraign the Juſtice of the Nation.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:152694:25"/>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Sanders</hi> (of Counſel for <hi>Pain</hi>) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd the raſhneſs and unadviſedneſs of the Act, but that it was not out of Malice; that he was no Papiſt, nor any of his Family; and how ingenuouſly it was done of him to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg his Letter, much more than to write it, and bring it to be printed. Mr. <hi>Gooding</hi> (of Counſel alſo for <hi>Pain</hi>) acknowledged him ſorry for what was done, and offered to give any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Yalden</hi> (of Counſel for <hi>Thompſon</hi>) plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the other two drew him in, and that it was honeſtly done of him to diſcover the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; and that what was in his <hi>Intelligences,</hi> was not ſo much his Fault as the Authors, for whom it was free to put what they would in there, he being paid for his pains.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Osborne</hi> (of Counſel for <hi>Farrell</hi>) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd it a fooliſh thing; but offer'd his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to be heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Farrell</hi> then, firſt of all, called one Mr. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,</hi> who depoſed, That he went along with <hi>Farrell</hi> to ſee Sir <hi>E. Godfrey</hi>'s Body at the <hi>White-Houſe.</hi> That he lay there upon a Table, and his Eyes were cloſed, and Shoes clean as if he had been upon an <hi>Hay-Mow.</hi> That he ſaw Gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets of Blood in the Ditch where he had lain, and likewiſe at a place where there were two or three things to go over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Batſon</hi> depoſed, That he alſo ſaw the Body at the <hi>White-Houſe,</hi> and the Blood in the Ditch; but that it looked to him, as if it had been laid there rather than any thing elſe.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:152694:26"/>
               <p>Then one <hi>Fiſher,</hi> who helped to ſtrip the Body at the <hi>White-Houſe,</hi> depoſed, That his Shoes were clean, and he ſaw no Blood but on his back-part, where was Blood; that he ſeemed to have been ſtrangled; and his Neck was ſo weak, that it might be turned any where.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>John Rawſon</hi> depoſed, That he help'd to carry the Body away out of the Ditch, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out the Sword; that he ſaw Blood upon ſome Poſts, and upon the Table where it lay, and on the Floor; and that there were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like Fly-blows in his Eyes; tho (being ask'd) he ſaid he ſaw no Flies buſy at that time of the Year. <hi>[At which the People laughed.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Rawſon,</hi> his Wife, only ſwore, That there was Blood and Water ran through the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and that many People ſaid there were Fly-blows, but ſhe did not mind it, tho there was ſomething like Fly-blows.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Farrell</hi> propoſed to prove the difference between <hi>Prance</hi>'s and <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Evidence, by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the Journals of the Houſe of Lords; and the Ld. Ch. Juſtice gave him leave freely to prove what he would or could: But he went off from this Proof, and called other Witneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Chaſe</hi> the Son, depoſed, That he ſaw no Blood in the Ditch, but he ſaw ſome four or five Yards off, which the Conſtable told him follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sword when it was pulled out. That he ſaw the Body in the Houſe, wherein was two Wounds, and a great Contuſion on the left Ear, his whole Face much bruiſed, and he believed him ſtrangled; and that thoſe Injuries offered him could not be after he was dead.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:152694:26"/>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> depoſed, That it was his Opinion he was Strangled, his Face was bloted, and the bloody Veſſels of his Eyes full, and he obſerved no Fly-blows.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Chaſe,</hi> the Father, depoſed, That he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Body beaten, from the Neck to the Stomach, ſo as he never ſaw the like. That Mr. <hi>Farrell</hi> telling him ſoon after what Proof he could make of this Buſineſs, he diſſwaded him, as being impoſſible to ſay any thing againſt it that had the face of Truth: That after his Book came out, Mr. <hi>Farrell,</hi> on <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Eve told him, That ſix Months before he had given him good Counſel if he had taken it.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> depoſed, That he ſaw no Fly-blows on the Body, nor ever ſaid he did, but that Mr. <hi>Farrell</hi> would have had him ſaid ſo; and another time told him, he was wrong in his <hi>Affidavit,</hi> as if he knew what he could make <hi>Affidavit</hi> of better than himſelf.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> depoſed, That he did not carry any of the Blood home in his Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, as <hi>Farrell</hi> had called him for to declare.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Lazingby</hi> was ſworn, to declare, Whether Men that kill themſelves, do not look as Sir <hi>E. Godfrey</hi>'s Body did? He depoſed, That he ſeemed to him to be ſtrangled, and that which ſtrangled him was kept about his Neck till he was cold, becauſe his Face look'd bloody and bloted; and that he put his Finger into the Blood, which lay ſome four Yards from the Ditch, and it ſmelt like that which comes from a Body after a Fortnight's Time dead, rather than a Weeks, it being Blood and Water; whereas the Water

               <p>
                  <hi>Farrell</hi> then proffer'd to prove himſelf no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt; but the Ld. Ch.

And Searj. <hi>Maynard</hi> obſerv'd how little Service his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes had done him, not one haying ſpoke on his ſide, but quite againſt him; and how little it belonged to ſuch Fellows as he to meddle in this Buſineſs, or to write about it; proffering to call ſome Witneſſes in, to prove him as wicked a Liar as lived; but it was thought unneceſſary, and was therefore waved.</p>
               <p>The Ld. Ch. Juſtice obſerving what liberty he had given the Defendant to call what Witneſſes he would, becauſe he was willing to hear what could be ſaid in the Caſe, whether a Doubt could be made in the World, that Sir <hi>E.

               <p>The Jury thereupon, without going from the Bar, found them all three Guilty of the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. And on <hi>Monday, July</hi> 3. they being brought to the Bar of the Court of <hi>King's Bench</hi> to receive the Judgment.</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Thompſon</hi> the Counſellor moved for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and further to ſatisfy the World, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Mr. <hi>Spence</hi>'s Affidavit before Mr. Juſtice <hi>Dolbin, July</hi> 10. 1682. wherein he had depoſed

               <p>The Clerk of the Crows ſaid, he knew this <hi>Spence,</hi> and that he was very like Sir <hi>E. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey.</hi>

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (of Counſel for the King in this Cauſe) opened it, and Sir <hi>Creſwel Levinz</hi> opened the Charge. After which, Mr. <hi>Reading,</hi> to ſave time, admitting thoſe Publick Paſſages laid in the Preamble of his Indictment, (as that <hi>Coleman, Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. were Executed for Treaſon; and that the Lords in the Tower were accuſed and impeached in Parliament for this Plot) Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> was ſworn, and depoſed, That Sir <hi>Trevor VVilliams</hi> brought him firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Priſoner; who began with him as a friendly Adviſer; in <hi>publick</hi> always preſſing him to diſcover what he knew of the Plot, but in <hi>private</hi> adviſing him to be cautions, and not to run at the whole Herd of Men, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating as if the Ld. Ch. Juſtice alſo ſeemed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at his forwardneſs, ſaying, that he would make the Parliament his Friends by proving the Plot; the King his Friend, in not charging all the Lords; and the Lords his Friends, by being kind to them. That the Perſons Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> moſt ſollicited for, were the Lords <hi>Petre, Powis,</hi> and <hi>Stafford,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Tichborn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Roper,</hi> Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> and <hi>Corker:</hi> That he ſhould have Mony, and an Eſtate, by the negotiation of the Priſoner at the Bar, to ſhorten the Evidence, and bring them off from the Charge of High-Treaſon. That he and Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> had ſeveral Conſultations about this matter; none of which he did conceal, but revealed them preſently to the Prince, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Counſellor <hi>Smith,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kirby</hi> and ſeveral others. And that he did not give in his full Evidence againſt <hi>VVhitebread,</hi> and <hi>Fenwick,</hi> a <hi>Ireland's</hi> Tryal, becauſe he was then
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152694:32"/>treating with Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> who had made him eaſie. That the Priſoner, in aſſurance of his Reward, told him, he had order to draw blank Deeds to be ſign'd in ten days after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of thoſe for whom the Sollication was made. That he and the Priſoner had a private Conſultation in his Bed-chamber, <hi>March</hi> 29. laſt, when Mr. <hi>Speke,</hi> and his own Man <hi>Henry VViggens</hi> were hid privately in the Room, and over-heard the main of the Conſultation and Overture of Mr. <hi>Reading;</hi> At what time Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> was to pen his Teſtimony as the Priſoner ſhould direct him, for the mitigation of the Evidence. That when that Paper was finiſhed, the Priſoner carried it to the Lords to conſider of it: And that after they had conſider'd of it, and mended it as they pleas'd, <hi>Reading</hi> return'd with the Emendations written with his own hand; and deliver'd them to Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> in the Painted-Chamber, who held them ſo behind him, that Mr. <hi>Speke,</hi> as it was agreed, took them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved out of his hand. [Which Paper being then Produced, was read in open Court.]</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> was ſworn, who depoſed, That on <hi>Saturday</hi> morning, <hi>March</hi> the 29th laſt, he was hid behind the Hangings, between the Bed's-head and the Wall, in Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (as was, agreed on before) and there he heard Mr. <hi>Reading</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Bedloes</hi> Negotiation together. That Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> asked the Priſoner, what the Lords ſaid to the Buſineſs, and what the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> ſaid to the Eſtate in <hi>Gloceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire?</hi> To which the Priſoner anſwered, That the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> had faithfully promiſed him to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152694:32"/>ſettle that Eſtate upon Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and that he had Orders from that Lord to draw up a blank Deed in order to the Settlement, which the ſaid Lord had engag'd to Sign and Seal within 10 days after he ſhould be diſcharg'd by Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe's</hi> contracting of his Evidence.—And that the Lords <hi>Powis</hi> and <hi>Petre,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Tich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn</hi> had faithfully engag'd and promis'd to give Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> a very fair and noble Reward, which ſhould be ſuitable to the Service he ſhould do them, in bringing them off from the charge of High-Treaſon. To which when Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> anſwer'd, that he would not rely upon their Promiſes only, but expected to have ſomething under their Hands; Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> reply'd, That they did not think it convenient ſo to do as yet, but that Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> might take his Word, as he had done theirs; and that he would engage his Life for the performance; With much other Diſcourſe, all tending to the ſame effect.—That on the <hi>Monday</hi> morning, he ſaw Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> deliver the Paper to Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> from whom he received it, and he and Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> read it immediately in the Lord <hi>Privy Seal's</hi> Room.</p>
               <p>After him, <hi>Henry Wiggen</hi>'s Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Man, depoſed, That he was concealed under the Rugg upon his Maſter's Bed, at the ſame time, and to the ſame intent as Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> was; giving the ſame Evidence, as to what had been diſcours'd of between the Priſoner and his Maſter in the Chamber; which afterwards he and Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> writ down.—And that he ſaw Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Paper to his Maſter in the <hi>Painted-Chamber,</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:152694:33"/>and ſaw Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> take it, who went with another Gentleman into the Lord <hi>Privy Seal</hi>'s Room with it.</p>
               <p>After this Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> began his Defence, Proteſting his own Innocency, producing Mr. <hi>Bulſtrode,</hi> only to teſtify that the occaſion of his going to the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> was his ſending for him; which yet he did not without leave from the Committee of Secrets. That then he was employ'd by the Lords, only to get them their <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>'s. And Sir <hi>Trevor Williams</hi> being called by him, declared how he only recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> to him for his Adviſe, about having his Pardon as perfect as could be. The Priſoner owning his being in Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Chamber at that time, and taking his Evidence, and carrying it afterwards to the Lords; but that it was purely out of Conſcience, and to prevent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and the Shedding of Innocent Blood; and the Deed diſcourſed of was only for 200 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> to be paid him by the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> within 10 days after he ſhould be diſcharged, <hi>pro Conſilio impenſo &amp; impendendo,</hi> to be ſecured upon an Eſtate in <hi>Gloceſterſhire;</hi> the which Mony, the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> indeed told him, when he had received, he might diſpoſe of it as he thought fit (which Confeſſion the Court declared amounted to the Confeſſion of the whole Charge.) Then he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd the beſpattering the Witneſſes; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating how Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> had vilify'd Dr. <hi>Stilling-fleet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Lloyd;</hi> and that he heard him ſay, he had by him ſeveral Witneſſes that would ſwear whatever he bid them; and that he laid in Proviſions of Fire, Coals and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152694:33"/>Billets, behind the <hi>Palſegrave-Head</hi> Tavern, and hard by <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> to burn the City of <hi>VVeſtminſter;</hi> which he produced one Mr. <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> to ſwear, and that he lent him Mony, as alſo he had Mr. <hi>Speke,</hi> which was yet unpaid (which proved to be 6 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> 8 <abbr>
                     <hi>d.</hi>
                  </abbr> for an Order, which was for Mr. <hi>Speke</hi>'s Brother); aſperſing them with being <hi>Eves-droppers;</hi> multiplying words, to little purpoſe. His Defence therefore being Artificial, (as the Lord Chief <hi>Juſtice</hi> told him) becauſe nothing to the purpoſe. Nay, Mr. Juſtice <hi>VVild</hi> told him, he diſgrac'd his Profeſſion by making ſo weak a Defence. And <hi>Bedloe</hi> own'd ſome of the Crimes he beſpattered him with, as part of the Guilt for which the King had given him his Pardon, and farther Depos'd, That Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> was to have 100 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> a Year, out of every 1000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> a Year of <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Reward.</p>
               <p>The Ld. Ch. Juſtice ſumm'd up the Evidence, to which the Ld. Ch. Baron added ſome little; and then the <hi>Jury,</hi> after a ſhort receſs, brought the Priſoner in <hi>Guilty.</hi> And then the Court Adjourn'd for half an hour when being met again, and the Priſoner at the Bar, The Ld. Ch. Juſtice Sentenc'd him, to be Fined 1000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> to be impriſoned for the ſpace of a whole Year; and to be ſet in the Pillory for the ſpace of one hour in the <hi>Palace-Yard</hi> in <hi>VVeſtminſter.</hi> On the <hi>Monday</hi> following he was Pillored according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Sheriff</hi> having a particular Charge of his Perſon; that nothing but Shame and Infamy might befal him, to which he had been condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and did deſerve as well as any Man that ever was convicted.</p>

               <p>THen and there the Court being met, and all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> preſent, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was made of Silence and Attention whilſt the King's Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner,</hi> and of <hi>Goal-Delivery</hi> were openly read; then the Priſoners being ſet to the Bar, <hi>James Corker</hi> (a Prieſt and Jeſuit, brought thither to be tried with them) preſented to the Court a Petition, ſetting forth that he was abſolutely ſurprized, and unprepared for his Trial, and therefore beſought the Court that he might not be tried till the next Seſſions. To which the Court ſeemed inclinable enough, nor did the <hi>Attorney General</hi> gain-ſay it, upon condition that he could really make it out, that he wanted Witneſſes, without which he could not make his Defence. However it was thought fitting that he ſhould hear the Charge that was againſt him read: to the end he might be able to give the Court an account what Witneſſes he had, that might avail him in reference to his Defence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:152694:34"/>againſt it, which being done, (the Indictment being in general for High-Treaſon, in conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Death of the King, the Subverſion of the Government, and Proteſtant Religion) the former Queſtion was put to him again, and then he named one <hi>Alice Gatton</hi> now at <hi>Tunbridg,</hi> as a Witneſs to prove that he was not in Town upon the 24th of <hi>April;</hi> ſo that being reſpited till the next day, the Court ſaid nothing farther to him that Sitting.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the Indictment was read, <hi>VVhitebread</hi> repreſented to the Court, that in regard he had been tried upon the 17th of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> before, upon the ſame Indictment; at what time the Jury being impanell'd, and the Evidence found inſufficient which came in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, the Jury was diſcharged without a Verdict, he was informed that no Man could be tried, and conſequently put in Jeopardy of his Life twice for the ſame Cauſe. For which reaſon he pray'd for Counſel to direct him upon that Point in matter of Law. He urged that his Life was in danger, as being deliver'd over in Charge to the Jury: and to make it out he alledg'd the Caſe of <hi>Sayer,</hi> in the 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> who having pleaded to a former Indictment for a Burglary, was indicted a ſecond time, upon which it was the Opinion of the Judges, that he could not be indicted twice for the ſame Fact. He likewiſe deſir'd a ſight of the Record, and that he might be informed, whether or no when a Perſon comes upon his Trial, he ought not either to be condemned or acquitted? Upon the whole matter, and his Motion together, the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152694:35"/>Court declar'd to him, that the Jury being diſcharg'd of him, his Life was in no danger. For that the Jury being ſworn to make a true deliverance or the Priſoners in their Charge, their Charge could not be full till the laſt Charge of the Court, after Evidence. Moreover, he was told that ſuch a Plea as he produc'd could not be ſupported without a Record, and it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there was none here, becauſe there was no Verdict; and beſides, this was not the ſame Indictment, in regard it contain'd new matter.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Fenwick</hi> offered the ſame Plea, his Caſe being the ſame, appearing before with <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread</hi> upon his Trial: but the Court return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Anſwer to him as to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, they both ſubmitted, and ſo all of them pleaded ſeverally <hi>Not Guilty</hi> to the Indictment.</p>
               <p>Then the Jury being to be impanell'd, they unanimouſly excepted (without naming them) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſt all thoſe Perſons that had ſerv'd before as Jury-Men in the ſame Cauſe, which the Court allowed them, as but reaſon.

               </p>
               <p>As to <hi>Fenwick,</hi> it was ſworn againſt him by Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> that when he came over in <hi>June,</hi> he met with <hi>Fenwick</hi> at <hi>Dover,</hi> who came with him to <hi>London,</hi> and upon his Box being ſeized by the Searchers, he heard him ſay, That if they had ſearched his Pockets, as they had his Box, they had found ſuch Letters as would have coſt him his Life; for, ſaid he, they were about our Concern in hand.

                  </abbr> which was for the four Aſſaſſinates at <hi>VVindſor</hi> in his own Chamber.</p>
               <p>Againſt him Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwore, that he being pitch'd upon to be one of the King's Murderers, was by <hi>Harcourt</hi> choſen to be diſpoſed of at <hi>London</hi> for that purpoſe, under the Tuition of one Mr. <hi>Parſons.</hi> That there was a Letter from <hi>Paris</hi> which paſs'd through <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s hands, to prove that it was the opinion of them at <hi>Paris</hi> and St. <hi>Omers,</hi> to fling the Death of the King upon the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> whereby they ſhould bring in the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Party into the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Company, to revenge themſelves of the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> and after that, to go on to a Maſſacre, and thoſe that eſcaped it, to be afterwards totally cut off by the Army.

                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> was agreed upon and appointed, as likewiſe the number of Maſſes, for <hi>Grove</hi> and <hi>Pickering</hi> for killing the King;—That he was one of thoſe that agreed and conſented to the addition of 5000 <abbr>

                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> to be given to Sir <hi>G. Wakeman.</hi> —That he brought <hi>Harcourt</hi> ſeveral Letters from <hi>Wotton,</hi> St. <hi>Omers, Bruges, Paris, Vallado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,</hi> and <hi>Salamanca,</hi> all of them for carrying on the Plot, ſhewing what Men, and Mony was in readineſs, and what more expected.—That the Contributions and Accounts lay generally in <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Hands, and that he had carried ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Papers from <hi>Harcourt</hi> to <hi>Langhorn</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame matter.—That he carryed a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult to St. <hi>Omers</hi> from Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> to whom <hi>Harcourt</hi> went with him, and that in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult was the main of the Deſign;—Alſo that he ſaw <hi>Harcourt</hi> give Sir <hi>G.

                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> telling him at
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152694:38"/>the ſame time, that it was in part of a greater Sum.</p>
               <p>Then two Papers were produced and read in Court, which Sir <hi>Thomas Doleman</hi> depoſed he found amongſt <hi>Harcourts</hi> Papers; the firſt was a Letter from one Mr. <hi>Petre,</hi> giving an account when the Conſult was to be, adviſing <hi>Secreſy, as to time and place, it appearing of its own Nature neceſſary.</hi> The other was a Letter from one <hi>Chriſtopher Anderton,</hi> dated from <hi>Hilton</hi> (by which was meant <hi>Rome</hi>) <hi>Feb.</hi> the 5th, 1677/8. wherein mention was made of the <hi>Patents</hi> being ſent thence: both which Letters the Priſoners ſtrugled much to vindicate by ſuch forced Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the matters they contained, as all the Court rejected.</p>
               <p>Againſt <hi>Gavan</hi> Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> depoſed, That he ſaw his Name to the Reſolve, though he could not ſwear he was at the Conſult of the 24th of <hi>April:</hi> That he gave an account from time to time of the Affairs of <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> and <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> relating to the Plot; and that coming to <hi>London,</hi> he gave the ſame account to <hi>Ireland</hi> his own Chamber, and talk'd of two or 3000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> that would be ready for the Deſign.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> then depoſed, that <hi>Harcourt</hi> had told him above a Year before, (as he was paying him for an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>) that there was a Plot upon the Life of the King.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> depoſed againſt him, that it was he who had engaged him in the Plot upon the Life of the King, and often perſwaded and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him to it.—That at <hi>Ewer</hi>'s and his Chambers at <hi>Boſcobel</hi> and other places, ſeveral
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:152694:38"/>Conſultations had been had about the Death of the King, and bringing in of Popery; wherein Mr. <hi>Gaven</hi> was always a great Man, being a good Orator to perſwade People in the Deſign: —That at the ſame Conſultations he had heard the Maſſacre often diſcours'd of. And that <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> ſhould ſay, <q>That tho they were but in a low condition themſelves, yet they would have Men and Mony enough to ſpare for ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</q>—That the ſaid <hi>Gaven</hi> had many times endeavoured to convince him of the Lawfulneſs if not the Merit of killing any perſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for the Advancement of their Religion.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Turner,</hi> it was ſworn by Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> that he was at the Conſult of <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Chamber, and ſign'd the Reſolve.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> alſo depoſed, that <hi>Ewers</hi> had told him that <hi>Turner</hi> was to carry on the Deſign in <hi>VVorceſterſhire.</hi>—That the ſaid <hi>Turner</hi> had met with <hi>Ewers, Leveſon</hi> and others, in ſeveral places, and had in every one of them given his conſent to, and aſſiſted with his Counſel in the carrying on of the grand Deſign of killing the King, and introducing of Popery.</p>
               <p>This was the main of the Evidence for the King. The Priſoner's defence lay chiefly in ſeeking to invalidate the Teſtimony given againſt them; and to prove <hi>Oates</hi> perjured; they produced theſe St <hi>Omers</hi> Witneſſes, who teſtify'd that he was not in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>April, viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hilſley, William Parry, Doddington, Gifford, Palmer, Cox</hi> (who differed in his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from all the reſt, and cauſed two great Laughters in the Court) <hi>Thomas Billing, Townley,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:152694:39"/>Fall, John Hall</hi> (Butler), <hi>Cooke</hi> (a Taylor); ſome of which were ſo poſitive, that they affirmed that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> never lay but two Nights out of the Colledg from <hi>December</hi> till the middle of <hi>June.</hi> — And to prove further, that he did not come over with Sir <hi>John VVarner,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Preſton</hi> (as he had depoſed elſewhere) one <hi>Bartlet</hi> (a Dutchman) <hi>Carlier Verron, Baillee</hi> (who ſpoke by an Interpreter) <hi>John Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Peter Carpenter</hi> appear'd.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Gaven</hi> produced two Witneſſes to prove him to be at <hi>VVolverhampton</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> at the time of the Conſult, <hi>viz.</hi> one Mrs. <hi>Kath. VVinford</hi> (at whoſe Houſe he there lodged) and <hi>Mary Poole,</hi> a Servant in the Houſe; the latter of whom was ſo lame in her Teſtimony, as cauſed both Laughter and Shouts. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced four more, that affirm'd him to be in <hi>VVolverhampton</hi> the laſt week in <hi>July,</hi> but none that could ſpeak to the other three weeks in that Month. However he proteſted his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and deſired to put himſelf upon the Trial of <hi>Ordeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>VVhitebread</hi> in his defence offered to prove D. <hi>Oates</hi> miſtaken in his Evidence at Mr. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Trial, which the Court would not allow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harcourt</hi> endeavoured to prove Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> miſtaken as to <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being with him in his Chamber in <hi>Auguſt.</hi> One <hi>Gifford,</hi> the Lady <hi>Southcott,</hi> Sir <hi>John Southcott,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edward South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cott,</hi> (his Son) Mrs. <hi>Harewel,</hi> her Daughter, <hi>Eliz. Keeling, Pendrel,</hi> and his Wife, two Mrs. <hi>Giffords,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> affirming him to have been moſt of that Month in <hi>Saffordſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:152694:39"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fenwick</hi> offer'd to invalidate Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, from his having been an ill Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>Creſwel Levinz</hi> (of Counſel for the King) ſumm'd up the Priſoners Defence, and to clear Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence about <hi>Ireland,</hi> he called <hi>Sarah Pain,</hi> who ſwore that ſhe ſaw <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in <hi>London</hi> about the middle of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> And for the Proof of Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s being in <hi>England</hi> at the time he ſaid he was, Mr. <hi>VValker</hi> (a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter) Mrs. <hi>Ives,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Mayo,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Barker, Philip Page, Butler,</hi> (his Servants) Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> (Schoolmaſter of <hi>Iſlington</hi>) and Mr. <hi>Clay,</hi> a Popiſh Prieſt; all depoſed as to his being ſeen in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> (78): to which the Priſoners only oppoſed the Number, and Innocency of their Evidence (being moſt young Boys). After which the <hi>Ld. Ch. Juſtice</hi> directed the Jury: and in ſumming up the Evidence, inſiſted particularly on <hi>Dugdal's</hi> Evidence concerning Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi>'s Death, as a mighty Confirmation of the Plot. —Then an Officer was ſworn to keep the Jury, who withdrew; and the Judges alſo went off from the Bench, leaving Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> and a competent number of Commiſſioners there to take the Verdict; and about a quarter of an Hour after, the Jury brought them all in <hi>Guilty.</hi> —Then the Priſoners were carried back to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and the Court adjourned till eight next Morning. And then Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> was tried, and found guilty: After which, they were all ſix brought to the Bar together, and received Judgment to be <hi>Drawn, Hang'd</hi> and <hi>Quartered:</hi> which accordingly was done upon theſe 5 Jeſuits and Prieſts, on Friday, <hi>June</hi> the 20th, at <hi>Tyburn.</hi>

               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was firſt called to give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the general Deſign, from which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it would be brought down particularly to Mr. <hi>Langhorn:</hi> who therefore depoſed, that he had been in ſeveral Conſultations for alteration of this preſent Government, and for the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Popery, and Murther of the King; that he was to have a Sum of Money to be one of them that ſhould kill the King; being put upon it by Mr. <hi>Ewers,</hi> Mr <hi>Gavan,</hi> Mr. <hi>Luſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vavaſor,</hi> all Jeſuits, that there was then to

               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> depoſed that he was told by the Lord <hi>Butler,</hi> that one Mr. <hi>Meſſenger</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Horſe to the Lord <hi>Arundel of VVar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> was by him imployed, and the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> to kill the King, for a good Reward: That Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> in his hearing, ſaid that the King was to be killed by ſeveral: And that <hi>Fenwick</hi> ſaid, Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> was to have a great hand in it: That then an Army of 50000 Men was to be raiſed and governed by the Lords <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Powis,</hi> to rain the Proteſtants, and ſettle the Catholick Religion, whereof he hath heard <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> ſpeak at the ſame time together.</p>
               <p>Then for the Proof of the particular matters of the Indictment, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was ſworn, who depoſed, That in <hi>April</hi> 1677, he went into <hi>Spain:</hi> and in <hi>September</hi> following, Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Sons came thither, the one a Scholar of the Engliſh Colledg at <hi>Madrid,</hi> the other of the Engliſh Colledg at <hi>Valladolid,</hi> to ſtudy Philoſophy in order to their receiving of the Prieſthood That in <hi>November</hi> following he returned into <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:152694:41"/>and brought Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> Letters from his Sons, which he delivered ſoon after his Arrival to him; telling him; at the ſame time, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd his Sons would both enter into the Society, whereat Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> ſeem'd mightily pleaſed, ſaying that by ſo doing they might quickly come to Preferment in <hi>England,</hi> for that things would not laſt long in the poſture they were in. That in the latter end of <hi>November,</hi> he returning to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> deliver'd to him a Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet to carry thither, wherein, when it was opened, he ſaw a Letter from him to the Fathers, giving them thanks for their care and kindneſs towards his Sons, promiſing them to repay them their charges of his Son's Journey into <hi>Spain</hi> (which was 20 <abbr>

That in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May</hi> when the Conſult was, to which ſeveral of them came over from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and at which, tho Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> was not preſent, yet that he had Orders from the Provincial to

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152694:42"/>
                  <hi>Langhorn</hi> was employed as Solicitor for the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, and went with <hi>Harcourt, Fenwick, Keines,</hi> and <hi>Langworth,</hi> and communicated the Secret to the Benedictine Monks, deſiring them to ſtand by them, with a Sum of Money for the carrying on the Deſign; upon which, as he heard, that 6000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> was promiſed, and that Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> was to receive it; which though he could not prove that he had, yet that he was ſure he was much diſguſted, that Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was not contented with 10000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> to poiſon the King ſaying, he was a covetous Man, that it was in a Publick Concern, and that being it was to carry on the Cauſe, it was no matter if he did it for nothing; but he was a narrow-ſpirited, and a narrow-ſoul'd Phyſician. That Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> alſo did know of 800000 Crowns come to <hi>France</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> from the Congregation at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> being ſworn, there was (as a Confirmation of what Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> had depoſed concerning the Commiſſions) an Inſtrument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced found by Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> in ſearching Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi>'s Study (a Papiſt) a good while after Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> had given his Teſtimony publickly, ſigned and ſeal'd juſt as the Commiſſions were. He then depoſed, that about three Years ſince he was ſent by Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>Le Cheſe;</hi> that the Letters were writ at <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Houſe, and brought open by Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Chamber in the <hi>Temple,</hi> where the Priſoner read and regiſtred them, and then <hi>Coleman</hi> ſealing them up, gave them to him to carry away. <q>The effect of which was to let <hi>Le Cheſe</hi> know, that they waited only
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152694:42"/>now for his Anſwer, how far he had proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the French King for ſending of Mony; for they only wanted Mony, all other things were in readineſs. That the Catholicks of <hi>England</hi> were in ſafety; had made all Places and all Offices to be diſpoſed of to Catholicks, or ſuch as they thought would be ſo; that all Gariſons were either in their own Hands, or ready to be put into them; that they had ſo fair an Opportunity, having a King ſo eaſy to believe what was dictated to him by their Party, that if they ſlipp'd this Opportunity, they muſt deſpair of ever introducing Popery into <hi>England;</hi> for having a King of <hi>England</hi> ſo eaſy, and the French King ſo powerful, they muſt not miſs ſuch an Opportunity.</q>— That about a Year and an half ſince, Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> ſent him with another Pacquet of Letters to Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> to Regiſter, wherein were two Letters that he before had brought from <hi>Spain,</hi> the one from Sir <hi>William Godolphin</hi> to the Lord <hi>Bellaſis;</hi> the other from the Iriſh Colledg of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits in <hi>Salamanca.</hi> That the Letter from the Rector did ſpecify, That they would have the Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> and the reſt of the Lords that were concerned, and the reſt of the Party in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to be in readineſs, and to have this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with all expedition; for that now they had provided in <hi>Spain,</hi> under the Notion of Pilgrims for St. <hi>Jago,</hi> ſome Iriſh caſhier'd Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and a great many of Lay-Brothers, to be ready to take Shipping at the <hi>Groin,</hi> to land at <hi>Milford-Haven,</hi> there to meet the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> and an Army that he was to raiſe in <hi>Wales</hi> to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:152694:43"/>further this Deſign. That alſo, he met with Father <hi>Keins,</hi> he brought a Letter from Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> in his Hand, which he ſaid was a chiding Letter, from the Secretary <hi>de propaganda Fide,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Barbarino,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> and the reſt of the Conſpirators, for going on no faſter when they had ſo fair an Opportunity.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Thomas Buſs,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Cook, was ſworn, who (being out of the way before) now depoſed to the Plot in general, That he in <hi>September</hi> laſt being at <hi>VVindſor,</hi> heard one <hi>Handkinſon</hi> bid one <hi>Anthony</hi> a Portugueſe, and the Queen's Confeſſor's Man, who was then drinking in their Company, that he ſhould have a ſpecial care of the four Iriſh Gentlemen he brought over with him, for that they would do their Buſineſs; whom, ſince he had ſeen <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Trial, he ſuppoſed to be the four Iriſh-Men that were to kill the King. Then this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> was ſent for by the Court to be took up, but <hi>Handkinſon</hi> was return'd beyond Sea.</p>
               <p>Then the Priſoner, in his own defence, offer'd to the Court, that the two Witneſſes againſt him, <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> were Parties to the Crime which was laid to his Charge; and therefore he deſired to know, whether they had their Pardon, or no? Which tho it were ſufficiently made out, yet the Court for his further ſatisfaction decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That whether they had or had not, yet they were good Witneſſes, or elſe they ſhould not have been admitted. Whereupon the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſtarted another Queſtion; Whether having had their Pardons, they might not fall under the ſame proſpect in Law with an Approver; not as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:152694:43"/>being Approvers, but as under ſome equivalence of reaſon for them? From whence he would have inferr'd, That if the Approver be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, the <hi>Appellee</hi> ought to be diſcharg'd. To which the Court replied, That an Approver was ever allow'd Maintenance, and that there ought to be a proof of corrupt Contract, or Subornation, to invalidate a Teſtimony. Then the Priſoner deſired to know, whether they had ever received, or did not expect Gratifications and Rewards for their Diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>To which Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> declared, That he was 6 or 700 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> out of Pocket, and knew not when he ſhould ſee it again. The Priſoner urged, That Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> had told him, that Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> had received 500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> But the Court inform'd him, that was for the diſcovery of the Murderers of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey.</hi> Then (theſe little Paſſes being all put by, and he having nothing to anſwer to the Fact) to invalidate the Witneſſes, he called in the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Gang, which had all been heard, and baffled but the day before, to prove that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> did not come over with thoſe Perſons he depoſed he did, nor at that Time, but was at St. <hi>Omers</hi> in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> which was the only Months they could anſwer any Queſtions about; becauſe (as one of thoſe Witneſſes very honeſtly confeſs'd) the Queſtion that he came for, did not fall upon any other Time. Others of them contradicted themſelves, as to what they had ſpoke the day before; one calling it the 24th of <hi>April</hi> New-Stile, who ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday call'd it Old-Stile; another <hi>June,</hi> who yeſterday ſaid <hi>July.</hi> And the Woman of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:152694:44"/>
                  <hi>VVhite-Horſe</hi> Tavern affirming her Houſe to be little, and that there was never a Room therein that could contain near ſo many as Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> had depoſed had met there at the Conſult; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral in the Court preſently contradicted her, affirming, that Fifty might dine at once in ſome of her Rooms. Then Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> would have urged ſomething againſt the Witneſſes which they had ſaid at other Trials; the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs whereof the Court ſhew'd him.</p>
               <p>Then ſeveral ſubſtantial Witneſſes being ſworn, (whereof one was a Papiſt) depoſed, That they ſaw Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 1678. which quite contradicted the St. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s Evidence.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> urg'd the St. <hi>Omer</hi>'s Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony notwithſtanding, againſt Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence; and affirm'd, that he had never ſeen Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> before that day; and that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that one that was in his way of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, ſhould become a Clerk to regiſter Letters; and that there was no proving a Negative; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming all Principles of Diſloyalty, leaving the reſt to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Ld. Ch. Juſtice then ſumm'd up the Evidence, and directed the Jury: And then a Letter found among <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Papers, five or ſix days after Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> had given in his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the King and Council, was produc'd, and read in Court, to confirm Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony about the Conſult.</p>
               <p>Then an Officer was ſworn to keep the Jury, who withdrew to conſider of their Verdict; and the Judges alſo went off from the Bench. After
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152694:44"/>a ſhort ſpace the Jury returned, and brought the Priſoner in <hi>Guilty;</hi> upon which there was a very great Shout.</p>
               <p>Then the five Priſoners caſt the day before, were all brought to the Bar, and received Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence together, To be <hi>Drawn, Hang'd,</hi> and <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd:</hi> Mr. Recorder applying himſelf firſt to them in a very handſom Speech.</p>
               <p>Which Sentence, after a Month's Reprieve, was executed upon him at <hi>Tyburn.</hi>

And then Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> was firſt called to give a general Account on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Plot. Who therefore being ſworn, depoſed, That for theſe ſeven Years he had known of the Plot, and for two Years particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly; and that in order thereto, the beſt way was, to kill the King; and to that purpoſe there were ſeveral Letters ſent weekly into <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> and very often directed to him in a Cover, wherein were ſeven or eight ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as from <hi>Ireland, Harcourt,</hi> and <hi>Grove,</hi> to ſome Prieſts in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> viz. <hi>Ewers,</hi> and <hi>Lewſon,</hi> and <hi>Vavaſor;</hi> and many times they writ of the Plots going on to kill the King, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing to Secrecy, and mentioning who ſhould be their Officers for an Army to be raiſed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. That he was engaged to be one of the Aſſaſſinates, firſt about two Years ago, but more preciſely in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi> laſt was 12 Month, and he ſhould have come up for that end to <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>October,</hi> there to have received Directions from <hi>Ireland;</hi> but the Plot breaking forth he was prevented; and that the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:152694:45"/>him that he ſhould have 500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> as part of his Reward; and when the Work was done, he ſhould be better gratified.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> depoſed, That about three Weeks before <hi>Michaelmaſs,</hi> he heard <hi>Fenwick, Grove,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> diſcourſing, in <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of 50000 Men that were to be raiſed for the ſetling of Popery; and he asking what poor Tradeſmen ſhould do? <hi>Fenwick</hi> ſaid, <hi>That he need not fear, for he ſhould have Church-VVork enough to make Crucifixes, Baſons, and Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,</hi> (being a working Gold-ſmith); and that this Army was to be govern'd by the Lords, <hi>Powis, Stafford, Arundel, Bellaſis,</hi> and <hi>Petre.</hi>—That he heard that one <hi>Meſſenger</hi> was to kill the King; but meeting him, the ſaid <hi>Meſſenger</hi> told him, <hi>They were off that now,</hi> but pray'd him however <hi>to keep Counſel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> depos'd, That he was in <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Chamber in <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet,</hi> when there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe a diſcourſe concerning the hopes of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Popery; and <hi>Ireland</hi> ſaid, There was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one in the way that ſtop'd the Gap, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Catholick Religion from flouriſhing in <hi>England</hi> again; and ſaid, It was an eaſy matter to poiſon the King; and that this was in <hi>June</hi> 1678. And on the 19th day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he ſaw <hi>Ireland</hi> again at his own Chamber, (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted what had before been depoſed in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>'s Trial, that he never was in <hi>London</hi> after the 3d of <hi>Auguſt</hi> till <hi>September</hi>); And this he proved by many remarkable Circumſtances, and ſtrengthen'd his own Evidence, by that of Mr. <hi>Bowes,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> who proved that Mr. <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon</hi> was then in <hi>London.</hi>

                  </abbr> more was offer'd him, as he was credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inform'd, by the Order of the Provincial <hi>VVhitebread;</hi> But that he certainly ſaw the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner's Hand to a Receipt in the Entry-Book at <hi>VVild-Houſe,</hi> for 5000 <abbr>

                  </abbr> (which he ſaid came from the Queen) which was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as he ſuppoſed, on ſome <hi>Goldſmith</hi> near <hi>Temple-Bar.</hi> That as ſoon as Sir <hi>George</hi> had read it, he ſaid, 'twas well, if it would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; that he found more Incouragement from his good Lady and Miſtreſs, than from any of them all.—That the Bill was accepted, and the Mony paid, by the Confeſſion of Sir <hi>George</hi> to the Witneſs. That the ſaid 2000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> was ſoon after made up 5000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and as <hi>Harcourt</hi> told this Deponent, all upon the ſame account, and in part of the 15000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George</hi> pleaded to all this, That he had been left at Liberty 24 days after he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council; and that upon Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent for to the Houſe of Lords to repeat his Evidence, he confeſs'd there, that he did not know Sir <hi>G. VVakeman</hi>'s Hand, and only knew the Letter in queſtion to be his Letter, by being ſubſcribed <hi>G. VVakeman;</hi> concluding from thence, that he would have told more at that Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had he known more. To which the Doctor replied, That he had been ſo over-toiled with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:152694:47"/>watching, and ſearching after Perſons detected, that he was not able to make good his Charge: Which was alſo confirm'd by the Teſtimony of Sir <hi>Thomas Doleman.</hi>—But Sir <hi>Philip Floyd,</hi> one of the Clerks of the Council, was more expreſs in behalf of the Priſoner, who acknowledged indeed that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> did make mention of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s undertaking to poiſon the King, as he had underſtood by a Letter from <hi>VVhitebread</hi> to <hi>Harcourt;</hi> and that he was inform'd by the ſame Letter, that <hi>Coleman</hi> had paid him 5000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> of the 15000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> agreed upon: But that being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of his own perſonal knowledg what he could tax Sir <hi>George</hi> withal, he ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that he had any thing more againſt him.— To which the Doctor gave the ſame anſwer of his extream Weakneſs and Indiſpoſition as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George</hi> alſo offered to prove, That there was nothing about poiſoning the King, in that his Letter to <hi>Aſhby,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chapman,</hi> and <hi>Hunt</hi> his Man, (the firſt ſhewing a piece of the Letter, and the other affirming that he writ it from his Maſter's Mouth, being then indiſpos'd) but the Court judging this to be ſome other, and not that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore, this was rejected as no Evidence.—Finally, Sir <hi>George</hi> recommended this one Obſervation-more to the Court; That in <hi>Oates</hi>'s Narrative, there was not one Letter which came from beyond-Sea, to which he did not ſwear poſitively as to the Date, and as to the Receipt; and yet that in the Caſe of Life he would not be confin'd to a Month. Concluding with a ſolemn Imprecation, and diſclaiming all
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:152694:47"/>the Crime in this Matter that had been charg'd againſt him.</p>
               <p>Againſt <hi>Corker,</hi> Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore, That he was privy to the Promiſe of the 6000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> which was to be raiſed among the <hi>Benedictines</hi> for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Deſign; and as being Preſident of the <hi>Benedictines</hi> he aſſented thereto.—That the ſaid <hi>Corker</hi> gave <hi>Le Cheſe,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monks at <hi>Paris</hi> an account of the Jeſuits Proceedings in <hi>England;</hi>—And that he had a Patent to be Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> which the Witneſs had ſeen in his hand;—And that he diſpoſed of ſeveral parcels of Mony (which they called the Queen's Charity) for advancing the Deſign.—That alſo he was privy to the Grand Conſult in <hi>April,</hi> and excepted againſt <hi>Pickering</hi>'s being made choice of for killing the King, in regard that he being engag'd to ſay High Maſs, an Opportunity might be loſt in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> further depos'd againſt him, That he had been with him in the Company of others at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> where he heard him diſcourſe in general concerning the Plot; of Letters of Intelligence, and raiſing an Army; What Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators the Conſpirators had in the Country, and what Intereſt they had made.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Corker</hi> offer'd, in his Defence, That not knowing his Accuſations he could not come with Evidences to ſupport his Plea—That there was nothing more eaſy than to accuſe an innocent Perſon, and that the Circumſtances ought to be as credible as the Witneſſes: of which there was neither to be found in his Caſe; uſing many Flouriſhes to move the Court and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152694:48"/>the Jury, raiſing his Arguments from Improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Witneſſes, to maintain his Allegations. —And the more to invalidate <hi>Oates</hi>'s Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, he produced one <hi>Ellen Rigby, Elizabeth Sheldon, Alice Broadhead,</hi> who teſtified, That one <hi>Stapleton</hi> was Preſident of the <hi>Benedictines,</hi> and not himſelf, and that the ſaid <hi>Stapleton</hi> had been ſo for many Years.</p>
               <p>Againſt <hi>Marſhal</hi> Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> depos'd, That he was preſent when the 6000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> was agreed upon, and that he made the ſame Exceptions againſt <hi>Pickering</hi> that <hi>Corker</hi> had done.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> ſwore alſo againſt him, That he had carried ſeveral Letters to Papiſts in the Country that were in the Deſign, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one to Sir <hi>Francis Ratcliff.</hi>—And that he had ſent Letters of his own twice to others concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubverting of the Government, and introducing Popery.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Marſhal,</hi> throwing himſelf upon the Court, whom he beſought to manage his Cauſe for him, as having had ſo much Trial of their Candour and Ingenuity, he made ſome ſlight Reflections upon the King's Evidence; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd the Court to conſider how-little concern'd he was at his being apprehended, which was no ſmall ſign of his Innocency; Relating the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, though very falſly, as Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> then ſwore.—But the main of his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence lay upon this ſtreſs, That Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was a ſtranger to him, and had miſtaken him for ſome other Perſon; which alſo was evidently made out to the contrary; beſides, that the Priſoner brought no proof of what he affirm'd
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152694:48"/>in that particular.—The Concluſion of his Defence was, a ſmooth Harangue, <hi>ad captandum populum,</hi> and in juſtification of the Crimes of the five Jeſuits that had already ſuffered; which, becauſe it was look'd upon as an affront done to the Juſtice of the Court, the Ld. Ch. Juſtice replied, in a very ſmart and excellent Harangue <hi>(whereat the people gave a Shout)</hi> again upon him, and the Court deſir'd him to forbear his Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Rhetorick, which were all to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Againſt <hi>Rumley,</hi> only Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore, That he was privy to the Conſult for the raiſing the 6000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and that he pray'd for the Succeſs of the Deſign.—And being but one Witneſs againſt him, he did not think it needful to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Court with a Defence; And indeed it was the Opinion of the Court deliver'd to the Jury, that they ought to diſcharge him.</p>
               <p>After this the Ld. Ch. Juſtice ſumm'd up the Evidences; taking Notice of the weakneſs of the Priſoners Defences; only expreſſing himſelf diſſatisfied at Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s excuſe of his own weakneſs and infirmity for not giving his full Charge againſt Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Board: Since he might have charg'd him in the ſame breath, that he denied he had any thing more againſt him. — Saying, it was ſtrange that the Priſoners ſhould have ſo little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and ſo little accquaintance with <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and ſo great a matter as they ſpeak ſhould be true, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as my Lord had done ſpeaking, Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> told him he had not ſumm'd up his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence right. His Reply was, <hi>I know not by what Authority this Man ſpeaks.</hi>

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Counſel for the King in this Cauſe, opened the Indictment, Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> purſued the Charge, and Sir <hi>Creſwel Levinz,</hi> his Majeſty's Attorney General opened the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>Then the Attainders of thoſe Perſons execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Plot, and the Impeachments of the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and of the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> mentioned in the Indictment, being allowed,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Radford,</hi> one of his Majeſty's Yeomen of the Guard, being call'd and ſworn, depoſed, That <hi>Richard Lane,</hi> who was a Yeoman of the Guard extraordinary, and Father of this <hi>John Lane,</hi> told him, about a Year ago, that Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> did attempt many times to Bugger his Son; but knowing him to be a lying Fellow, he durſt not ſpeak of it again, for fear he would have put it upon him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> only depoſed, that in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> laſt, when <hi>Lane</hi> was out of Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Service, he deſired him to interceed for him; which he did, till he was admitted again.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Samuel Oates</hi> (the Doctor's Brother) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152694:52"/>That in <hi>April</hi> laſt, about a Fortnight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Lane</hi> went from his Brother, he heard him ſay, (having before wiſhed for 1000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr>) that he queſtioned not but e're long he ſhould find a way to get 1000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr>—Then offering to ſpeak to <hi>Osborn,</hi> as to the Thing it ſelf, he was not ſuffer'd, as being no Evidence againſt the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, till ſomewhat had been proved upon them.</p>
               <p>Therefore the King's Counſel propoſed to prove, that <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborn</hi> (who, tho laid in the Indictment to join, was run away) did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and afterwards recant it; and that <hi>Knox</hi> had an hand in all this. And to this end,</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> was called, and depoſed, That Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi> and he were order'd, by a Committee of Lords, (before whom a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> had been brought, of the horrid abuſe of his two Servants, <hi>Osborn</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi>) to take their Examinations; which he did, and that <hi>Lane</hi>'s Evidence upon Oath was, That he had been induced by Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> to betray his Maſter, and to ſwear ſeveral Things againſt him, which <hi>Knox</hi> had drawn up, and dictated to him, which <hi>Osborn</hi> writ, and he ſigned them. That there were four Letters, three or four Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, and three or four Informations, which they had carried (<hi>Knox</hi> accompanying them) to have ſworn them before Mr. <hi>Cheney;</hi> who not caring to meddle with them, they applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Mr. <hi>Dewy,</hi> who refuſed them likewiſe. After this <hi>Knox</hi> took Lodgings for them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving them to ſeveral places, leſt Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſhould hunt them out; bidding them ſtand firm
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:152694:53"/>to what they were to do, and they ſhould not want for Reward, that would maintain them with Footmen, and to live well. That <hi>Knox</hi> did, at the <hi>One-Tun</hi> Tavern, drop a Guiny upon the Table, which he ſaid he would not give, becauſe then they might ſwear that he never gave them any Mony: And told them, that the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer would never have ſurrendred himſelf to the Black Rod, unleſs they had promiſed to ſtand faſt to what he had dictated to them: One part of which Information was, that Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe</hi> ſhould ſay to Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> that the Earl of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> offered him a conſiderable Sum of Mony to go beyond-Sea; and that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of abuſing <hi>Lane</hi>'s Body.—That <hi>Lane</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confeſs'd that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> would be ſomething haſty and paſſionate, but was very Religious, and was conſtant in ſending his Servants to Prayers; and that he had accuſed him of a Falſhood by the inſtigation of <hi>Knox,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him to it, by the Promiſes of a great Reward.—That alſo, to prevent a Diſcovery, it was agreed among them, that if any one ſhould betray it, the other two ſhould murder him.— That he did likewiſe declare, that the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> would not be wanting to acknowledg the kindneſs in diſparaging the King's Evidence. —And that at all the Places, and ſeveral Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Entertainments they had been at, were all at <hi>Knox</hi>'s Charge, except twice which might amount to about 18 <abbr>
                     <hi>d.</hi>
                  </abbr> and that he paid.—And upon the Examinations of <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborn,</hi> he found they agreed together to a tittle.—That he took alſo the Examination of <hi>Knox,</hi> who
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:152694:53"/>ſaid, that the Papers he received from <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborn,</hi> who ſaid, they had writ them out of trouble of Conſcience, and deſired him to go with them before ſome Juſtice to ſwear them; denying that he paid for their Lodgings, only that he did indeed drop a Guiny, and another time 10 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> upon the Bed, which they took up, but he only lent it them. Confeſſing, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſo drawn up, and delivered into his Hands, were by him delivered into the Hands of the Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> and were there for ſome time; this <hi>Knox</hi> belonging to the Lord <hi>Dunblane.</hi>— That <hi>Knox</hi> confeſs'd alſo, that he ſent a Note to <hi>Osborn</hi> that day he was examin'd, which was conveyed to him through the Door, to this effect; <hi>We always Club'd, and you paid two Shillings at the Sugar-Loaf. Tear this.</hi> Which was to intimate that they ſhould ſay, he did not bear their Charges.</p>
               <p>Then Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi> being ſworn, depoſed, That he alſo had took <hi>Lane</hi>'s Examination, wherein he had confeſſed as before. That alſo he was by, when he was brought before the Lords of the Committee for Examinations, and did hear him there firſt ſwear the things in theſe Notes contained; and then come afterward and beg their pardon, and God's, for what he had ſworn was falſe, and this too was upon Oath. That he heard <hi>Knox</hi> confeſs about the Note to <hi>Osborn,</hi> and he took Lodgings for <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborn</hi> in <hi>VVhite-Friers,</hi> by the direction of the Lord <hi>Dunblane</hi>'s Coachman.</p>
               <p>Then one <hi>Rix</hi> depoſed, That he help'd <hi>Osborn</hi> into Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Service, and a while after he and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:152694:54"/>
                  <hi>Lane</hi> came to him, and ſaid, they were both going off from the Doctor to preferment, and ſhould have 100 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> a Year, and 500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> apiece, but would not tell how. Another time <hi>Osborn</hi> came to him to borrow a Cravat, for he was going to dine with one of the greateſt Peers of the Realm, at the other end of the Town, (this Diſcourſe being at <hi>VVhite-hall</hi>); and asking why he would leave Dr. <hi>Oates?</hi> he ſaid, Let Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> look to himſelf, for he had enough againſt him. Then perceiving ſome Deſign, he gave in his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to Juſtice <hi>VVarcup;</hi> and upon further inquiry into it, the Lords ordered him to ſend out his Warrants for the taking of <hi>Knox, Lane,</hi> and <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,</hi> which he aſſigned over to him; and in a ſhort time after they were taken. <hi>Osborn</hi> then confeſs'd to Juſtice <hi>VVarcup,</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> to Sir <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam VValler.</hi>—Afterwards <hi>Rix</hi> drinking with <hi>Lane</hi> in the Priſon, would have paid, but he would not let him, for that he had 23 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> which he ſaid <hi>Knox</hi> had ſent him in. Another day he came to him, and <hi>Lane</hi> ſhew'd him a Note (which he had put under the Door) from a Gentlewoman; <hi>That if he would ſtand firm to his Text, he ſhould have</hi> 500 <hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr> nay, he ſhould not want</hi> 1000 <hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr> But in caſe they would not, the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer would never have come in; and if they did not, he would loſe his Head:</hi> And this <hi>Lane</hi>'s Father and Mother told him afterwards, and that one <hi>Heſt</hi> did come and tell them ſo.—That alſo <hi>Lane</hi> told him his Heart was lighter now he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd this; and that <hi>Knox</hi> ſet him on, drew up the Writings, and promis'd him thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:152694:54"/>
               <p>Then <hi>Richard Slightam</hi> (a Priſoner and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Goaler) depoſed, That <hi>Knox</hi> gave him three half Crowns at one time, and promis'd him a conſiderable Sum to carry Notes between him, and <hi>Lane,</hi> and <hi>Osborne,</hi> but he carried none; And when <hi>Osborne</hi> had confeſs'd, he ſaid it would ſignify nothing, becauſe two were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than one.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Dewy</hi> depos'd, That at the end of <hi>April,</hi> or beginning of <hi>May, Knox</hi> came to him, with two more with him, and ſaid, the Ld. <hi>Latimer</hi> wiſh'd him ſo to do, with Papers ready written, which, as ſaid, were the Informations of one <hi>Osborne</hi> and <hi>Lane,</hi> who had over-heard Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> conſpiring againſt the Lord of <hi>Danby;</hi> but the Parliament then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he ſhifted them off, and did not inſpect them.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Henry Wiggens</hi> (Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Clerk) depoſed, That <hi>Knox</hi> came to him, the latter end of <hi>February</hi> laſt, and deſired him to get him a Copy of his Maſter's Papers, and take a Journal of his Actions and the Names of the Perſons that came to him; and that the Lord Treaſurer would incourage him for his pains; ſaying, <hi>That</hi> Oates <hi>and</hi> Bedloe <hi>were two great Rogues, and that the King knew them to be ſo, and believed not a VVord they ſaid; and as ſoon as he had heard all they could ſay, they ſhould be hang'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mrs. <hi>VViggens</hi> depoſed the ſame, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent all the time that <hi>Knox</hi> was with her Son, who refuſed that her Son ſhould conſent or go then with him, as <hi>Knox</hi> motion'd, to the Lady <hi>Danby</hi> for aſſurance of Encouragement,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:152694:55"/>and any Place in her Lord's diſpoſal.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> (a Yeoman oth' Guard, and one that attended Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> and got <hi>VViggens</hi> into his Service) depoſed, That Mr. <hi>Wiggens</hi> made a diſcovery to him of what <hi>Knox</hi> had ſaid to him, for to acquaint his Maſter with, which he did.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Thomas Dangerfield,</hi> depoſed, That he in <hi>June</hi> was imployed by the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> to look after the Priſoners, <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Knox,</hi> in the <hi>Gate-Houſe,</hi> and did furniſh <hi>Lane</hi> with Mony, and got him bail'd out; after which he was entertain'd at <hi>Powis</hi>-Houſe, and then removed, and had 10 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> a week allowed him, and was clothed.—That <hi>Knox</hi> afterward got his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, by the means of one Mr. <hi>Nevil,</hi> who was furniſhed with Mony from the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> for that end. From this <hi>Knox</hi> he received ſeveral Papers, which were Informations againſt <hi>Oates,</hi> which he ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and thence they were ſent to Mr. <hi>Nevil</hi> to enlarge upon, and after to the Ld. <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> and then to him again by Mrs. <hi>Celier,</hi> with an Order to draw up an Affidavit according to thoſe Directions, and get <hi>Lane</hi> ſworn to the ſame; which he did before Sir <hi>James Butler,</hi> (it being about Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery); and then he deliver'd the Papers ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, to <hi>Knox</hi> again: Who ſome time after inform'd the Witneſs, that he had got <hi>Osborne</hi> ſworn alſo to the ſame Informations, and ſhew'd him the Affidavit, whereof he gave an Account to the Lady <hi>Powis;</hi> who, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Poverty, order'd him Encouragement, and accordingly he has 40 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> from the Witneſs, which he believed came from the <hi>Tower,</hi> as alſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:152694:55"/>that 10 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> a Week allowed for <hi>Lane.</hi> An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment was hereupon to have been drawn up againſt <hi>Oates,</hi> by the Advice of Mr. <hi>Nevil,</hi> and this Witneſs, againſt this Term.</p>
               <p>Then the King's Counſel moved for the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Information. The Juſtices ſwore them, and then the Information of <hi>Knox</hi> was read, which was a relation how <hi>Osborne</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> brought him the Information againſt <hi>Oates,</hi> deſiring him to aſſiſt them in getting them ſworn to them.—A Second Paper was offered to be read, but there appearing Scandalous Matter to be in it, reflecting on the King, the Court thought not fit to ſuffer any more to be read.—And ſo the Counſel for the Defendants were called upon to ſpeak. Accordingly Mr. <hi>VVithens,</hi> Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> and Mr. <hi>Scroggs,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to defend their Client <hi>Knox,</hi> by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Guilt upon <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborne,</hi> as if they had induced him in, and he only acted for them out of Simplicity, and great Innocency; And to this end they produced <hi>Lane</hi>'s Mother and Siſter, to ſhew that <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Osborne</hi> applied themſelves to <hi>Knox</hi> firſt. Mr. <hi>Holt.</hi> and Mr. <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> were of Counſel for the Defendant <hi>Lane,</hi> who endeavour'd (in requital) to throw the Guilt upon <hi>Knox,</hi> as being t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Inducer, making it a Battel Royal, where every one has two Enemies to oppoſe.</p>
               <p>But the Caſe being clear, the Court thought it needleſs to ſum up the Evidences, or the Jury to go away from the Bar; ſo laying their Heads together, they preſently declared them <hi>Guilty.</hi> At which the People gave a great Shout: and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152694:56"/>the Priſoners were taken into the Marſhal's Cuſtody.</p>

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> opened the Indictment, Sir <hi>John Keiling</hi> purſued the Charge, and Serjeant <hi>Strode</hi> (all of Counſel for the King in this Cauſe) managed the Evidence.

The next day accordingly he went into <hi>Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s Chamber to Confeſſion, and received Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and the Sacrament from another, to whom <hi>Anderſon</hi> ſent him that was ſaying Maſs at that time. After which returning to <hi>Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> again, he told him, that he as a Prieſt did give him free Toleration to go and be drunk with one <hi>Stroude,</hi> being for the good of the Cauſe (he being to bring over this <hi>Stroude</hi> to be a Witneſs for the Lords in the Tower, to inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi>'s Teſtimony). Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that he was a Prieſt, a <hi>Dominican</hi> Friar, that he had heard him ſay Maſs, ſeen him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the Sacrament, been at Confeſſion with him, and ſeen his Letters of Orders, as a Prieſt, which he confeſs'd to him he had from <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he was an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Man, and the Son of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> depoſed, That he was a Prieſt and an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Anderſon</hi>'s Son of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> and he was told, that he had heard him ſay Maſs, and ſeen him adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament

               <p>Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> depoſed, That he had heard him ſay Maſs ſeveral times at <hi>VVild-houſe,</hi> and had ſeen him there take Confeſſions, and give the Sacrament, having known him ſeven Years.</p>
               <p>To this Priſoner pleaded, that it had not been proved that he was an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> tho his Speech betrayed him, and confeſs'd his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi>-Man, and that he had been countenanc'd by the King and his Council, and known to moſt of the dignify'd Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and if the Parliament had not been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, he had been protected by them for his writing againſt the Temporal Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he was therefore excommunicated by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had not ſaid Maſs in any Pariſh Church this ten Years: And that this Statute was only <hi>ad Terrorem,</hi> and ought to be taken moſt ſtrictly in his favour. The Ld. Ch. Juſtice then gave a ſhort Charge to the <hi>Jury</hi> concerning him and ſet him aſide. And then the <hi>Jury</hi> was charged with <hi>James Corker</hi> as with the other; againſt whom Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that he was <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monk, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 1674, one of the Queen's Prieſts; that he had heard him ſeveral times ſay Maſs in a Monks Habit, at <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe</hi> and the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and himſelf had received the Sacrament from him at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and had ſeen his Patent from <hi>Rome</hi> to be Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> depoſed, That he had ſeen him wear the Habit of a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monk before the Suppreſſion of the <hi>Convent</hi> in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:152694:57"/>had ſeen him take Confeſſions, and Abſolve in <hi>Somerſet-Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> depoſed, That he heard him ſay Maſs once at Mr. <hi>Paſton</hi>'s in <hi>Duke-ſtreet,</hi> about two Years ago.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner's Defence was only a flat De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, that ever he ſaid Maſs either in <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Paſton</hi>'s. So the <hi>Jury</hi> was charged with <hi>William Marſhall</hi> as with the other; againſt whom Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> alſo depoſed, that he had heard him ſay Maſs ſeveral times within the compaſs of three Years, in a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks Habit, and ſeen him Abſolve, and conſecrate the Hoſt, and give the Sacrament at the <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> could only depoſe, that he ſaw him once in the <hi>Savoy</hi> in his Monks Habit, and was told he was going to take Confeſſions.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> depoſed, that at his laſt Trial he heard <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſay to <hi>Corker, Tho we are Prieſts, this does not reach us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> depoſed, that he alſo then heard him confeſs himſelf a Prieſt: To this the Priſoner pleaded, that he made no ſuch Confeſſion; or if he did, it ought not to be Evidence againſt him. That he was almoſt a Stranger to the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Oates</hi> was never ſeen there but once, and was not to be believed now, becauſe the <hi>Jury</hi> did not convict him upon his Teſtimony when he was tried before, and that it was now a Proſecution of his former Malice again to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him after he had been disbeliev'd. For all which falſe Inferences having been rebuked by the Court; the Lord Chief Juſtice ſumm'd up the Evidence: And proceeded to <hi>William
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:152694:58"/>Ruſſel,</hi> alias <hi>Napper,</hi> with whom the <hi>Jury</hi> being charg'd as the others, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> depoſed, that he had heard him ſay Maſs in his Prieſts Habit, and himſelf had received the Sacrament from him at <hi>Wild-houſe,</hi> and that he was a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friar.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> depoſed, that he had heard him ſay Maſs twenty times, and ſeen him give the Sacrament, and hear Confeſſions at <hi>Wild-houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> depos'd, that when he took him, he found Religious Habits among his Clothes, which he owned to be his.</p>
               <p>To all which the Priſoner had little to ſay more than denying all. Therefore <hi>Charles Parris,</hi> alias <hi>Parry,</hi> was charged to the Jury as the reſt. And againſt him Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore that he had heard him ſay Maſs at <hi>Wild-houſe</hi> and Mr. <hi>Paſton</hi>'s, and conſecrate the Hoſt, and give the Sacrament in Prieſts Habit.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> ſwore, that he knew him to be a Prieſt, and had heard him ſay Maſs at the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Ambaſſadors, and at Mr. <hi>Paſton</hi>'s, and that he bought Oil-boxes once of him and brought him a Chalice, and would not ſuffer him to touch it till himſelf had firſt broke it; and that he heard him confeſs himſelf to be a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner denied all, and ſaid that he knew not <hi>Prance,</hi> and that he was a <hi>Windſor</hi> the time that <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore he heard him ſay Maſs, and produced one <hi>Lanſcroon</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> (Painters) who teſtified to his being there from before <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> 1677, to <hi>All-hallontide</hi> 1678; but the time Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore to was <hi>November</hi> before. He offer'd the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſador's
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152694:58"/>Certificate that he never ſaid Maſs in his Houſe, which was refuſed (the Embaſſador being gone away) and Monſieur <hi>Rivier,</hi> one of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador's Servants, teſtified he never ſaw him there, but the Court rejected ſuch Teſtimony. And the Ld. Ch. Juſtice having ſumm'd up the Evidence, went out of the Court; and <hi>Henry Starkey</hi> was next ſet up, with whom the Jury was charged as with the others. And againſt him Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> depoſed, that the Priſoner was a Prieſt, and he heard him once ſay Maſs at Mr. <hi>Paſton</hi>'s in the Habit, and ſaw him conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the Hoſt, and receive in both kinds.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> depos'd, that he heard him confeſs himſelf to one Mr. <hi>Duncomb</hi> a School-maſter, that is dead, that he was a Prieſt, and heard him ſay Maſs at his Houſe, and the Lady <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Paſton</hi>'s, and had heard him ſay that he ſaid Maſs in the King's Army.</p>
               <p>To this the Priſoner pleaded how he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for the King, when he had but 500 Men; that he was an Eſquires ſecond Brother, and had ſpent in the King's Service above 5000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> which he had got himſelf, and bled for it before he had it; and that he ſpent his Annuity of 140 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> a Year for the King, and had loſt his Leg for him, and diſcover'd to him a Plot againſt his Perſon, State, and Government, and that he ſuffer'd to this day for it. But as to his being a Prieſt he ſaid nothing, but left it to the Proof, which the Ld. Ch. <hi>Baron</hi> ſumm'd up. And then the Jury was charged, as before, with <hi>Alexander Lumſden,</hi> againſt whom Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore that he had heard him ſay Maſs twenty times at <hi>Wild-houſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:152694:59"/>and had ſeen him conſecrate the Hoſt, and had received the Sacrament from him, and that he was a <hi>Dominican</hi> Friar, and <hi>Procurator General</hi> for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being a <hi>Scotſman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwore, that he heard him confeſs himſelf a Prieſt, that day he was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> depos'd, he had heard him ſay Maſs twenty times at <hi>VVild-houſe</hi> in his Habit, and ſeen him conſecrate the Hoſt.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner ſaid he was a <hi>Scotſman,</hi> born at <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> The Ld. Ch. <hi>Baron</hi> ſumm'd up the Evidence, and the Jury withdrew for about a quarter of an hour, and brought in <hi>Anderſon, Corker, Marſhall, Ruſſel, Parry</hi> and <hi>Starkey</hi> Guilty; and <hi>Lumſden</hi> guilty of being a Prieſt, and born at <hi>Aberdeen</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Then the Judges went off the Bench, and the Court proceeded to Judgment; <hi>Anderſon</hi> ſaid he had gone out of <hi>England</hi> before, but that the King kept him, telling him he had need of his Service, and he had a Protection from the Council-Board. The <hi>Recorder</hi> promis'd him to acquaint the King with what he ſaid, but that he muſt now be ſentenc'd. <hi>Corker</hi> ſaid little; <hi>Marſhall</hi> ſaid much to little purpoſe, urging his Majeſty's Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, and that there was no Crime in Prieſthood it ſelf. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> only deny'd what had been depoſed againſt him. <hi>Parry</hi> ſaid that he was a <hi>French</hi>-Man, tho of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. <hi>Starkey</hi> pleaded his Merits as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And then <hi>Lumſden</hi> being ſet aſide, Mr. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder</hi> ſentenc'd theſe ſix to be drawn, hang'd and quartered.</p>

                  </abbr> at a time, to prevent Suſpicion, by the hands of <hi>Richard Phiſicke;</hi> and about the beginning of (77) he heard the Priſoner ſay, that he had returned it, and that if it had been a thouſand times as much, he would be glad to ſpend it all in ſo good a Cauſe. In (77) that there was a Conſult at <hi>Barnbow</hi>-Hall in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> (which is the Priſoner's Houſe) where was Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton, Charles Ingleby</hi>

                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> a Year for ever, for the maintenance of this Nunnery. Upon which they all agreed, that after his Death, he ſhould be canonized a Saint.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:152694:60"/>reſide near a Year and an half till the Plot was diſcovered, and he had ſeen ſeveral Leters from them to the Priſoner—That about <hi>March</hi> laſt Eſquire <hi>Gaſcoyne</hi> and Mr. <hi>Middleton</hi> got Licences from a Juſtice of Peace to travel to <hi>London,</hi> and he heard them tell the Priſoner they deſigned to fly into <hi>France;</hi> and accordingly ſold off their Goods; the Priſoner approving their Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. —That on <hi>May</hi> the 30th laſt, the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bid the Witneſs go into the Gallery, where one <hi>VVilliam Ruſhton</hi> his Confeſſor came to him, and diſcours'd him about his having taken the Oath of Allegiance, telling him it was a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sin, he having thereby denied the Power of the Pope to abſolve him from it; but that the Pope had Power to depoſe the King, and had done it, and that it was a meritorious act to kill the King; and if he would undertake to do it, he would aſſiſt him, and give him Abſolution: quoting that Scripture, <hi>Thou ſhalt bind their Kings in Fetters, and their Princes in Chaines;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that the King was depoſed, and it was meritorious to kill him, and that unleſs he would turn Roman Catholick, the Pope would give away his Kingdoms to another.—The ſame day the Priſoner talked with him in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and inquired of him what <hi>Ruſhton</hi> had ſaid to him; which he told him; and then taking him by the hand, the Priſoner told him, if he would undertake a deſign that he and others had to kill the King, he would give him 1000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> but refuſing to be concerned in Blood, he deſired him of all Love to Secreſy.—That in <hi>September</hi> 1678. he heard the Priſoner tell his Daughter,

That he was a Proteſtant when he came firſt to the Priſoner's Service, and turn'd Papiſt about <hi>VVhitſontide,</hi> 1675. and left his Service in good Friendſhip, <hi>July</hi> the 1ſt, 1678. and turn'd Proteſtant again in <hi>June</hi> 1679. when he firſt made this diſcovery.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mowbray</hi> depoſed that he came to lie with Sir <hi>Tho. Gaſcoyne</hi> the beginning of 1674. and uſed to wait upon him in his Chamber, and to be diligent in attending Mr. <hi>Ruſhton,</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, at the Altar, who therefore permitted him to be preſent in his Chamber, where he heard him and other Prieſts diſcourſing in 1676 of a Deſign laid for ſetting up Popery, and how likely it was to ſucceed, moſt of the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> having engaged to act for it, and if it could not be done by fair means, force muſt be uſed; declaring that <hi>London</hi> and <hi>York</hi> muſt be fired; and that the King in Exile had promiſed the Jeſuits beyond Sea, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their Religion, whenever he was reſtored, which they now deſpaired of, and therefore he was adjudged an Heretick, and was to be killed; and <hi>Ruſhton</hi> told the other Prieſts that according to Agreement, he had given the Oath of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and the Sacrament to the Priſoner, and his Son and Daughter, who had engaged to be faithful, active and ſecret. That about <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas</hi> there was another meeting of theſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:152694:61"/>Prieſts and others; where they declared, that the King was an Heretick, and that the Pope had excommunicated him, and all other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that force was to be made uſe of. And then did <hi>Ruſhton</hi> produce a Liſt of about 4 or 500 Names, of them that were engaged in the Deſign of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King, and promoting the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; which <hi>Ruſhton</hi> read over, among which were the Names of the Priſoner, <hi>Tho. Gaſcoyne</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the Lady <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vavaſor,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Hungaſt,</hi> Sir <hi>John Savile,</hi> the two <hi>Townleys,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sherborn</hi> and others; and he knew the Priſoner's Name to be writ by his own hand. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared alſo, that the Pope had given Commiſſion to put on the Deſign with ſpeed; and had given a plenary Indulgence of 10000 Years, for all that ſhould act either in Perſon or Eſtate for killing the King, and ſetting up Popery in <hi>England,</hi> beſides a Pardon and other Gratifications. That the Prieſts that uſed thus to viſit <hi>Ruſhton,</hi> were one <hi>Addiſon, Fincham, Stapleton, Killingbecks,</hi> and <hi>Thwing</hi> the elder.—That about the ſame time he heard the Priſoner, the Lady <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> and <hi>Ruſhton</hi> diſcourſing the ſame things, and unanimouſly conclude, that it was a meritorious Undertaking, and for the good of the Church, wherein they would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their Lives and Eſtates.</p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoyne</hi>'s Almanack was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and ſeveral ſhort Notes read out of it, which he owned to be writ by himſelf, <hi>viz. The</hi> 15th <hi>to Peter for a</hi> 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> 
                  <hi>to</hi> Corker. — <hi>Q. of Mr.</hi> Corker, <hi>what Bills, for how much, and to whom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,

               <p>Then two Letters from <hi>Placid,</hi> alias <hi>Cornwallis,</hi> to Sir <hi>Tho. Gaſcoyne,</hi> and found among his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers by <hi>Bolron,</hi> were read. The firſt was dated from <hi>Dolebank, June</hi> the 9th, 1678. expreſſing Thanks for his charitable Favours; and ſpeaking of a <hi>Proviſo</hi> to be inſerted into the formal Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That if <hi>England</hi> be converted, then the whole 90 <abbr>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:152694:62"/>as it is worded, adding, that three Breves have formerly been ſent from the Pope, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly prohibiting it; and in the third it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared damnable to take it. And that the day before they had a Letter communicated to them, ſent by Mr. <hi>Middleton</hi> (now at <hi>Paris</hi>) to his Friends here, containing the Atteſtation of all the <hi>Sorborn</hi> Doctors againſt it; adding, that whoſoever here in <hi>England</hi> give leave, they deceive the People, and are contrary to the whole Church. That there was alſo a meeting ſome Years ago, of all the Superiors both Secular and Regular, wherein it was unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly declared that it could not be taken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Phiſwick</hi> depoſed that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned great ſums of Money for the Priſoner at <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all this the Priſoner in his own defence, called ſeveral witneſſes againſt the Credit of the Kings Witneſſes, who had depoſed this againſt him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Babbington</hi> teſtified that there was, laſt Spring, ſome Debates and Differences about Rent and Money that was owing by <hi>Bolron</hi> to the Priſoner. That he (being the Priſoner's Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) laboured and interceded often an <hi>Bolron</hi>'s behalf, but at length not being able to prevail that he ſhould not be ſued, <hi>Bolron</hi> ſwore that he would then do that which he did not intend to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obadiah Moor</hi> ſaid that <hi>Bolron</hi> got him to be bound with him, telling him he needed not fear any Suits, becauſe if Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ſued him, he would inform againſt him for keeping Prieſts. And that ſince he diſcover'd, he deſired him to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:152694:63"/>be kind, and not to harm him, becauſe he had often denied, and ſworn it, that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was not concerned in this Plot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stephen Thompſon</hi> ſaid, that he alſo being bound with <hi>Bolron</hi> for the Mony, he urged him for Paiment; who on <hi>Holy-Thurſday</hi> told him, that if Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> did ſue him, he would do him an ill turn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Blackhouſe</hi> ſaid, that when he went to fetch <hi>Bolron</hi> and his Wife to teſtify what they knew, before a Juſtice of Peace; that <hi>Bolron</hi>'s Wife ſaid ſhe knew nothing againſt Sir <hi>Tho. Gaſcoyne;</hi> but <hi>Bolron</hi> ſaid ſhe muſt go, or he would have her drawn at the Cart's Arſe.</p>
               <p>— <hi>Hamſworth</hi> ſaid, he heard <hi>Bolron</hi> threaten his Wife to tie her to the Horſes Tail, if ſhe would not go to ſwear againſt the Priſoner, againſt whom ſhe ſaid ſhe knew nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicholas Shippon</hi> ſaid that on <hi>May</hi> the 30th laſt, <hi>Bolron</hi> was at his Houſe from two a Clock till an hour after Sun-ſet; which <hi>Bolron</hi> denied, ſaying, he was not there above half an hour, being the reſt of the day at Sir <hi>Tho. Gaſcoynes</hi> ſeeing them mark Sheep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roger Greſſon</hi> ſaid, that in <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, <hi>Bolron</hi> being newly come from <hi>London,</hi> and he inquiring how Sir. <hi>Tho. Gaſcoyne</hi> did (who was then in the <hi>Tower</hi>) he told him he was well, and may come off well enough, but it would, coſt him a great deal of Mony.—And that the King was at <hi>Windſor,</hi> where one of the privy Council made an attempt to ſtab him, but the King made his eſcape, and how they would believe his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations the better.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:152694:63"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>James Barlow</hi> appeared to have ſpoken to a Combination between him and <hi>Mowbray</hi> to have wrong'd the Priſoner of ſome Mony; but he being a Perſon concern'd with the Priſoner in the Plot, was not ſuffered to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>George Dixon,</hi> a Cloth-worker in <hi>Leeds,</hi> ſaid he ſaw <hi>Mowbray</hi> and <hi>Bolron</hi> a drinking in <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, at <hi>William Batley</hi>'s near the Old Church in <hi>Leeds,</hi> and over-heard them, contriving to ſwear againſt the Priſoner and the Lady <hi>Tempeſt;</hi> but <hi>Mowbray</hi> ſaid he knew nothing againſt Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas;</hi> but that if he knew any thing againſt the Lady <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> he would diſcover it; for he would hang her if he could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Batley</hi> teſtified the ſame; only they contradicted one another; this Man ſaying they ſtood at the head of the Stairs, the other at the foot; one ſaying they could ſee them, the other that they could not.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Jefferſon</hi> ſaid, that in <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, ſhe heard <hi>Mowbray</hi> ſay that he thought Sir <hi>Tho. Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyne</hi> was an honeſt Man, and wrongfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matthias Higgringil</hi> ſaid that in <hi>September</hi> laſt <hi>Mowbray</hi> and Mr. <hi>Legat</hi> being at an Ale-houſe, conſulting how to diſgrace the Priſoner, and take away his Life; <hi>Mowbray</hi> called him aſide, and told him, now he ſhould match them (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sir <hi>Tho. Gaſcoyne</hi> and the Lady <hi>Tempeſt</hi>) for that they had done what they could to diſgrace him (he having been charged with taking away ſome Silver and Gold) but now he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Francis Johnſon</hi> only ſaid the priſoner had ſuſtained Loſſes by <hi>Bolron,</hi> but knew of no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice between them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Pebles,</hi> Clerk of the Peace in the County of <hi>York,</hi> ſaid he met with <hi>Bolron</hi> laſt Aſſizes at <hi>York,</hi> and after ſome diſcourſe <hi>Bolron</hi> told him he had ſomething againſt him; and afterwards got a Warrant of the Council againſt him; for keeping a Man from taking the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance for Mony;— but could never prove it; and that he had an inn ſame in the Country.—But <hi>Bolron</hi> ſaid one confeſſed to the Juſtice, that he had given <hi>Pebles</hi> 40 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> but would not ſwear for what.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hardwicke</hi> ſpoke only to the Unwillingneſs of <hi>Bolron</hi>'s Wife to go to ſwear before a Juſtice of Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Clow</hi> ſaid he had a Writ againſt <hi>Bolron</hi> at the Suit of <hi>Higgringil</hi> (a Servant to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner) which was ſerved upon him, <hi>May</hi> the 22d laſt, and he begg'd he might not go to Goal till <hi>Higgringil</hi> came, for he would make Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> pay his Debt for him, or he would play him ſuch a trick as he little dream'd of.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobart</hi> then gave ſome account of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney returned by the Priſoner to <hi>London,</hi> he having drawn the Receipts for it, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by Mr. <hi>Corker</hi> for the Priſoners Neece Mrs. <hi>Apleby,</hi> who was beyond Sea.</p>
               <p>Then a Woman witneſſed, that <hi>Mowbray</hi> was ſuſpected of ſtealing, while he lived with the Priſoner; and proffered her 5. <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> to have gone away, intending (as he told her) to have clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped her in Priſon, and laid it upon her.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:152694:64"/>
               <p>Then the Priſoner having no more Witneſſes, and referring himſelf to the Judgment of the Court; the Kings Counſel endeavoured to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Credit of their Witneſſes; and firſt Sir <hi>John Nicholas</hi> (Clerk of the Council) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the Priſoner did before the Council ſay that he had nothing to ſay to <hi>Bolron</hi>'s Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, till of late that he had not behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo well in giving Informations againſt him. But he did find him now, what he did always take him to be, a Fool: And that he denied at firſt that he knew <hi>Ruſhton</hi> the Prieſt; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the next time he came to the Council, he ſaid he did deny it, becauſe he was afraid of an old Law againſt harbouring of Prieſts.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Bolron</hi> alſo depoſed that her Husband ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver threatned her, if ſhe would not ſwear againſt the Priſoner.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Bolron</hi> ſen. (Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi>'s Grandmother) ſwore the ſame; and that ſhe heard the Priſoner ſay Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> was an honeſt true Servant; and he would do any thing he could for him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Phiſwicke</hi> alſo depoſed that he knew no ill by Mr. <hi>Bolron,</hi> but that he was an honeſt Man.</p>

               <p>Then Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> (of Counſel for the Defendant) pleaded, That it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that this particular Paragraph was writ by Mr. <hi>Care,</hi> but it might be a Sham put upon him by ſome Papiſts that might have an ill will to him, who had been no Friend to them, by this means to have Juſtice come upon him. And that however indiſcreetly he might do it, yet no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice was proved therein. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> (ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Counſel) pleaded, That it could not be ſuppoſed that a good Man, and a good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſhould do an ill Action:</p>
               <p>And to prove him ſuch, Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> depoſed, That Mr. <hi>Care</hi> had been with him at Church; and that by the Converſation be had had with him, he apprehended he might be the Author of the <hi>Pacquet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Ambler</hi> only teſtified, that Mr. <hi>Care</hi> had been at Church with him, and that the common Report was, that he was the Author of the <hi>Pacquet of Advice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Ayliffe</hi> alſo teſtified, that he had ſeen him at Church, and Divine Service, but that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver asked him whether or no he writ this.</p>
               <p>After which Mr. Recorder reply'd, upon the Defendant's Counſel, That it was unlikely that the Papiſts did write this particular Paper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mr. <hi>Care</hi> writ a Weekly Intelligence, and no other Intelligence came out that Week but this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ld. Ch. Juſtice then directed the Jury in a long Speech, taking notice of the Noiſe and Shouts which had attended this Trial; and which had quite altered the Caſe from Mr. <hi>Care</hi>'s,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:152694:66"/>to a Publick Concern; telling the Court, how they did the like in the Caſe of <hi>Harris,</hi> whom yet they had forſaken as ſoon as he was in Goal, for 500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> which 5 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> apiece would have diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him from, if they were as free of their Purſes, as they were of their Noiſes and Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations: So that in Truth they are only violent againſt the Government, whilſt they can make Shouts and Noiſes; but if it come once to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Man from a Penal Sum, they will let him rot in Goal; this being the Complaint of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and the Diſparagement of all theſe Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and brave Fellows that ſeem to eſpouſe the Cauſe, and affront the Government. And that hereby they had now ruin'd and undone <hi>Care,</hi> if ſo be he were found <hi>Guilty,</hi> whom otherwiſe he ſhould have thought a more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sentence might have ſerv'd.—</p>
               <p>The Jury then withdrawing for about an hour, brought the Defendant in <hi>Guilty,</hi> and the Ld. Ch. Juſtice, and Mr. Recorder told them, They had done like honeſt Men.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:152694:67"/>which was for High-Treaſon, for conſpiring the Death of the King, and ſubverſion of the Government and Proteſtant Religion: And to this end expending divers Sums of Mony to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons to procure them to kill the King, and to impoſe the ſaid Treaſons upon the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:152694:68"/>Deſign; the Letter being ſhewn him before it was ſealed. Which Letter he delivered to <hi>Strange,</hi> the then Provincial, to give to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. And that in <hi>December</hi> following the ſaw a Letter at St. <hi>Omers</hi> from the Priſoner to the Fathers, wherein he gave them an account of his Letter from <hi>Spain,</hi> and was glad the Fathers there had ſo good an Opinion of his Integrity in the Cauſe.—That in <hi>March</hi> he ſaw another Letter of the Priſoners to the Fathers at St. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> importing his diſlike that the Secular Clergy ſhould be truſted with the Deſign.—That in <hi>April</hi> he came over into <hi>England</hi> to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult; ſoon after which he ſaw the Priſoner come, and enquire about the Copies of ſome Letters to be ſent up into <hi>Germany,</hi> and did deſire that an Agreement between them (the Jeſuits) and the Monks might be made up, that ſo they might have the Aſſiſtance of that Order to carry on the Deſign.—That afterwards he heard the Priſoner, and Mr. <hi>Langworth,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fenwick,</hi> talking in <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Chamber about the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the Conſult, and how unanimous the Fathers were in ſigning of it; and the Priſoner then ſaid, That <hi>now he ſhould be reveng'd for the Injuries done to him.</hi>—That he ſaw in <hi>Strange</hi>'s Hand an Account of a Divorce that was between the Priſoner, and <hi>Barbara</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Cleve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> And that he heard the Priſoner ſay, he had been at great Expence about a Divorce; and a Prieſt's Chamber being ſearched, there was a Paper found wherein the whole Caſe was ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Then the Priſoner, and the Ld. Ch. Juſtice
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:152694:69"/>croſs-examin'd Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> a long time to have catch'd him, but were not able.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was called; but the Priſoner oppoſed his being ſworn, becauſe he had been Out-lawed for Felony, and burnt in the Hand for Felony; and the Records were produced. But Mr. Attorney General ſhewed, his Pardon, by which he was reſtored. But this the Priſoner deſired his Counſel might ſpeak to, <hi>Whether a Man branded, and burnt in the Hand for Felony, and afterwards pardoned, can be a good Witneſs?</hi> Which being granted him, he named Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> Mr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Darnel</hi> for his Counſel. But Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> was not in Court, and Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> ſaid he was not prepared to ſpeak. But Mr. <hi>Darnal</hi> gave his Opinion in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive alledging for it, 11. <hi>Henry</hi> 4.41. and 9. <hi>Jac.</hi> and the Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> p. 154. To which the Attorn. General, and Mr. Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the conſtant Cuſtom and Practice of the Court; the ſame did Mr. Sol. General, and Mr. Recorder.—Then Mr. Juſtice <hi>Raymond</hi> went down to the Court of <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> to know their Opinion; who brought word, that it was the Opinion of their Brethren, That a Man convicted of Felony, and not burnt in the Hand, a Pardon could not ſet him Upright; but being convicted, and burnt in the Hand, they ſuppoſe he is a Witneſs.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was ſworn, who depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, That about 12 Months ago, the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> ſent him with a Letter to the Priſoner; who writ back an Anſwer, which the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> read to him and Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> the Contents of which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:152694:69"/>were; <hi>This Perſon I like well, and though he be no Scholar, he will ſerve to inſtruct the Youths as he ſhall be directed.</hi> By the Youths, he ſaid, was meant the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Witneſſes, whom the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner was employed to inſtruct what to ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Trial.—That his Lordſhip employed him to get <hi>Lane</hi> out of the <hi>Gate-houſe.</hi>—That his Lordſhip was concern'd alſo in thoſe Letters which related to the promoting of the Sham-Plot, and were to be conveyed into the Houſes of ſeveral Perſons of Quality; and ſent 40 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> for his part to pay for copying them.—That the next day after he had been treated with in the <hi>Tower</hi> to kill the King, which he refuſed; he waiting upon the Priſoner, his Lordſhip ask'd him why he would refuſe to kill the King? it being that for which he was took out of Priſon, and was violently angry with him; upon which he left him.</p>
               <p>After this the Priſoner began his Defence; and againſt <hi>Oates</hi> produced a Record (which was read in Court) of his proſecuting a Man of Buggery at <hi>Haſtings,</hi> whom the Jury Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted; After which, coming to <hi>London</hi> he was converted to be a Papiſt, by one <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> whom ſince <hi>Oates</hi> hath converted to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant; which Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> then appearing teſtifyed; but talking extravagantly, the Court was informed he was a diſtracted Man.</p>
               <p>Then one <hi>Armſtrong</hi> appeared to teſtify that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was only a Common Scholar at <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidolid;</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> that he was but the ſame at St. <hi>Omers.</hi>

               <p>Then <hi>Hilſley</hi> affirm'd, That he left <hi>Oates</hi> at St. <hi>Omers</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> and did not come over with him; and to corroborate his Teſtimony, one <hi>Osborn</hi> affirmed, that Mr. <hi>Hilſley</hi> told him ſo about the latter end of <hi>April.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then one Mr. <hi>Gregſon,</hi> at whoſe Houſe Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> Iodged, appeared only to teſtify to the Poverty of <hi>Oates,</hi> and that he had nothing but what the Jeſuits allowed him.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Littcot</hi> teſtified, that he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Divorce; but the Court refuſed to hear ſuch Evidence, as not being to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Then the Records were produced againſt <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> of his being burnt in the Hand, Outlawed for Felony, and twice Pilloryed for putting away falſe Guineys, and a gilt Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> teſtified, that <hi>Dangerfield</hi> told her of the Priſoner's Anger this time 12 month (which <hi>Dangerfield</hi> ſaid was in <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt) and that ſhe would have ſent him with a Letter, but he refuſed to go near his Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Bennet Dowdal</hi> ſaid, That <hi>Dangerfield</hi> told him in <hi>June</hi> of the Priſoner's Anger, and that it was becauſe he went to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and his Lordſhips Name unknown to him.</p>
               <p>The Lady <hi>Powis</hi> affirmed alſo, That ſhe never ſent a Letter by <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> nor never read one to him in her Life; and Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> affirm'd the ſame.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi> then depoſed of his ſeeing <hi>Oates</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> and that his Servants told him, they ſaw him in <hi>May,</hi> (78)</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:152694:70"/>
               <p>Then one <hi>Turner</hi> depoſed, That he ſaw <hi>Dangerfield</hi> with the Priſoner, as he believes, in <hi>July</hi>—And one <hi>Woodman</hi> depoſed that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Letter from Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> to the Priſoner, and brought back 30 <abbr>

               <p>Then the Priſoner would have cleared his Reputation, about inſtructing the Youths, but the Court judg'd it needleſs. Therefore Mr. <hi>Attorney General</hi> ſumm'd briefly up the Evidence, and the Ld. Ch.

               <p>To whom the Indictment being read, Mr. <hi>Gibbs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Holt,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> being of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in this Cauſe for the King, opened the ſame. After which Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> himſelf was ſworn, and depoſed, That upon <hi>April</hi> 15. (being <hi>Thurſday</hi> in <hi>Eaſter-Week</hi>) laſt, he was with ſome Company at the <hi>Devil</hi>-Tavern, till 10 or paſt, and recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had Buſineſs with Mr. <hi>Phillip</hi>'s, a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor at Law, in <hi>Bell-yard</hi> that Night, he left his Company, and his own Servants being out of the way, he went to the Room where ſeveral of his Neighbour's Servants were, and called to ſome of them to go with him; but it happen'd he went away without them; And as he went croſs <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> he ſaw two Men in Campaign-Cloaks follow him, whom he thought to be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants belonging to ſome of his Company, who had followed him on his calling. But as he went into <hi>Bell-yard,</hi> one of them got before him, and turned, and looked earneſtly in his Face, whom paſſing by, when a Woman ſtood in a Door about the middle of <hi>Bell-yard</hi> with a Candle in her hand, he ſaw to be this Priſoner at the Bar; to whom when his Companion came up, he heard them laugh aloud. He took no Notice, but went on; and at the Kennel, at the end of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:152694:71"/>
                  <hi>Jackanapes-Lane,</hi> he looking down to find the Kennel, a Cloak was thrown over his Head, and then he found very rough Hands about his Shoulders, and they can him into <hi>Jackanapes-Lane</hi> juſt croſs the Lane, againſt the oppoſite Wall, and run his Head ſo hard, that he thinks they broke it, and then ſtruck him, and at the ſecond blow he fell, running him through his ſide into the Belly; Then recovering, he made what Defence he could; but with a broad Sword he was run through his Arms, and with a ſmall Weapon he was run through in another place of his Arm. He had ſeveral other Wounds; and one of them ſetting his Foot hard upon his Breaſt, and keeping him down, he believes was run into the Leg, by one of his Companions; for he heard him ſay, <hi>Dam-me thou haſt ſpoyl'd my Leg.</hi> They laughed all the while, and were exceeding merry. He had then on a pair of Bodice of Whale-Bone, notwithſtanding which he had four or five Wounds in his Body through them, for they were not proof; but they imagin'd they were, finding their Swords double ſometimes; and one of them ſaid, <hi>Dam-me he has Armour on, Cut his Throat.</hi> Immediately one kneeled down, and gave him ſeveral Cuts in the lower part of his Face; he did what he could to defend himſelf, but they gave him ſome indellible Marks. By a Candle in a Window, in Sir <hi>Timothy Baldwin</hi>'s Houſe as he ſuppoſed, and ſome Women in his Yard, giving them the firſt diſturbance, and a Boy coming by with a Link the ſame time, he both ſaw the Face of <hi>Giles,</hi> and remembred it was he whom he had
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:152694:72"/>ſeen in the Lane juſt before. They then pulled the Cloak from off him, and he ſeeing the Light, and being eaſed of the Weight, he ſtrain'd all his ſtrength, and cried out; and then Company came in, and carried him into the <hi>Sugar-Loaf,</hi> and from thence to his Lodging, where his Friends came to him, and a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was ſent for. And that as the Aſſaſſinates went away from him, they clapt their Swords cloſe to their Bodies, and went away laughing aloud; one of them ſaying theſe Words: <hi>Now you Dog pray for,</hi> [or <hi>pray again for</hi>] <hi>the Soul of Captain Evans</hi> (who was a Jeſuit, taken by him in <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and Executed at <hi>Cardiffe</hi> for being a Prieſt; Who when the Under Sheriff came to give him notice, that he had a Warrant for his ſpeedy Execution, the ſaid <hi>Evans</hi> being in a Game at Tennis, ſaid, <hi>God Dam-me I will play out my ſet firſt.</hi>)— To all which <hi>Giles</hi> only ſaid that Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> knew him very well, and that his Wife was a near Relation of his.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Stephen Phillips</hi> depoſed, That the next day in the Evening, about 8 or 9 a Clock, he was drinking with <hi>Giles</hi> at the <hi>Crown</hi>-Tavern in <hi>New-ſtreet</hi> in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and diſcourſing about Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi>'s Misfortune among the reſt, Mr. <hi>Giles</hi> talking of it, ſaid, <hi>God dam him,</hi> or <hi>God Rot him, he had Armour on, they ſay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Walter Watkins</hi> depoſed, That on <hi>May</hi> 5. he being at the ſtating ſome Accounts between Mr. <hi>Giles</hi> and Mr. <hi>Richmond,</hi> at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ske</hi> in <hi>Monmouth-ſhire:</hi> He asked <hi>Giles</hi> for ſome Horſe-Hair to make a Fiſhing-Line, <hi>Giles</hi> replied, That he had left very good Hair for him at a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:152694:72"/>Farriers in <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> but he and Mr. <hi>Herbert Jones</hi> made ſuch haſte through <hi>Gloceſter</hi> that they did not call for the Horſe-Hair; and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the occaſion of his Haſte, he anſwered, it was for fear they ſhould be ſtopt in their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as ſuſpected to be concerned in Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi>'s Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>George Richmond</hi> then (with whom <hi>Giles</hi> ſtated the Accounts) depoſed the very ſame; adding, That he could not ſay whether <hi>Giles,</hi> called him <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
                  <hi>Arnold,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> or what; he ſeldom uſed to give him ſo good words.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Walter Powel</hi> ſwore, That he being at one <hi>Peter Darcy</hi>'s Houſe, a Sword-Cutlers in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ske; Giles</hi> came to him to have his Sword mended; and <hi>Darcy</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Where have you been, you have been hot at it: What have you been fighting with the Devil? No,</hi> ſaid <hi>Giles, with Damn'd Arnold.</hi> Upon this, <hi>Darcy</hi> ſaid he muſt not ſpeak ſuch words; and <hi>Giles</hi>'s Wife pluck'd him by the Coat, and bid him hold his Tongue. This was on <hi>May</hi> 5. and there were by, the Priſoner at the Bar, and his Wife, and <hi>Darcy</hi> and his Apprentice.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>William Richmond</hi> depoſed, That <hi>Giles</hi> asked him in the Afternoon before Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> was hurt, Where he might buy a good Rapier? And that he had then a good Back-Sword in the Houſe. That he endeavour'd to have prevented the Execution of Father <hi>Lewis;</hi> and when he was executed, was very active a dipping Cloaths in his Blood. That the day of the Aſſault, he and <hi>Giles</hi> went into <hi>Long-lane</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:152694:73"/>together, to inquire after their Friends, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the <hi>Artillery</hi> to ſee the Exerciſe, then to <hi>Long-lane</hi> again, from thence to <hi>Whetſtones-Park,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Drury-lane:</hi> and about 9 at Night they came to their Inn, being the <hi>Kings-Arms</hi> in St. <hi>Martins-lane,</hi> and he left <hi>Giles</hi> taking a Pipe of Tobacco in the Kitchin, and went up into his Chamber, with ſome other Company, and drunk till nigh One; and about 12 ſeeing the Maid making up another Bed, he ſtept to her, and asked her who it was for? ſhe ſaid, for a Man that was not willing to lie with any Body; After this, about one a Clock, as he was going to Bed, he heard <hi>Giles</hi> com up ſtairs, and bid him Good-night, juſt as he was pulling off his Breeches.</p>
               <p>Then one Mr. <hi>Bridges</hi> depoſed, That about a Year ago, he heard <hi>Giles</hi> ſay, That the Papiſts were the beſt Religion, and that thoſe that were not of that Religion, were Damn'd; and that he that ſays there is a Plot, is a Rogue, and a Thief.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Walter Moor</hi> alſo ſwore, that he had heard him ſay, That if the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> were Executed, there would be a greater War than ever was in <hi>England;</hi> and it would coſt more Blood than ever was ſpilt, which he ſwore, ſaying, The Lords deſerved not Death, for that there was no Plot at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Reynold</hi> depoſed that on <hi>May</hi> 2 at <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goone</hi> in <hi>Monmouth-ſhire,</hi> he heard <hi>Giles</hi> ſay, That he could not think but that Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> wounded himſelf; ſays his wife, How could he wound himſelf in his Arms? ſaid he, It was himſelf, or ſome of his Friends.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:152694:73"/>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> the Chyrurgeon depoſed, That he found Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> bleeding, with two Wounds through his Arm, one Wound and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Bruiſes in his Head, two Cuts on his Face, another upon his Throat, which bled very much; two upon his Breaſt, and one in the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſix Inches and an half deep. — Which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he could not give himſelf.</p>
               <p>[Fifteen or ſixteen Witneſſes more for the King, that were attending in the Court, were not examin'd, the Court being in ſome haſte, and the King's Counſel not preſſing it, there being ſo full Evidence.]</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Darnall,</hi> being of Counſel for the Priſoner, began a Defence, and called Mr. <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot,</hi> who ſaid, He was at the Crown-Tavern with Mr. <hi>Giles</hi> when Mr. <hi>Phillips</hi> was; and he heard no ſuch Saying; but that <hi>Giles</hi> ſaid, if any thing ſhould be upon Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> it was a very ſtrange thing;—and was ſorry for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Herbert Jones,</hi> Mayor of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> then depoſed, That he went with <hi>Giles</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> and came with him to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and inn'd at the <hi>Old-Bear;</hi> and after Dinner went to the <hi>New-Bear</hi> and drank Sider, and ſtaid ſeveral hours in Town; and being the quarterly Seſſions, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral came to them to ask News; and they told of Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi>'s Hurt, and were as ſorry for it as any Perſons could be, and confeſs'd it a very ill thing. — That he ſuppoſed Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> muſt needs be acquainted with <hi>Giles,</hi> he having been head-Conſtable, and always a Proteſtant.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>John Jones</hi> the Cutler's Apprentice ſwore, That his Maſter asking the Priſoner,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:152694:74"/>Mr. <hi>Giles,</hi> Have you been in ſome Battel? Have you been fighting with the Devil? <hi>No,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for I never met with</hi> Arnold. And that he did not hear his Wife bid him hold his Tongue.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>John Howel,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Richmond</hi>'s Man, depoſed, That he came to Town with <hi>Giles</hi> that Day about 12; and that he heard him call to his Maſter about 11 or 12 a Clock that Night.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Ann Beron</hi> being ſworn, ſhe depoſed, That <hi>Giles</hi> was in her Company moſt part of that Day, and that ſhe was at Dinner with him, and till 9 a Clock at Night, when ſhe left him in the Kitching, and went to Bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elizabeth Crook,</hi> the Maid of the Inn, ſhe ſwore ſhe made his Bed about 10, and before 11 asked him, if ſhe ſhould take away his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle? He bid her lock the Door, and he would put out his Candle; but ſhe went away, and did not, and left the Candle: She denied that Mr. <hi>Richmond</hi> came to her, or that ſhe ſaw him, till he refreſh'd her Memory, by remembring her how he courted her, to make himſelf merry; which then ſhe acknowledged, much to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Mr. <hi>Richmond</hi>'s Teſtimony, and diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of her own.</p>
               <p>Then one <hi>Edward James</hi> did ſwear, That he drank with <hi>Giles</hi> at the <hi>King's-Arms</hi> in St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin's-Lane,</hi> from 9 to 12 at Night, and then left him in the Kitchen, the ſame Night the Maid had ſworn otherwiſe juſt before him.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Robin Gibbon, John Chadwick, Eliz.</hi> — <hi>Peter Powel,</hi> and <hi>Roger How,</hi> all ſwore they ſaw him about 9; but that was not material.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:152694:74"/>
               <p>To theſe Witneſſes the King's Counſel thought it needleſs to anſwer, they being all either frivolous, or contradictory.</p>
               <p>Therefore Sir <hi>George Jefferies</hi> the Recorder ſumm'd up the Evidence, and directed the Jury, who withdrew, and after about half an hours debate, brought the Priſoner in <hi>Guilty.</hi> Which done, the Court adjourn'd till the Saturday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, when the Recorder paſſed the Sentence of the Court upon him, which was, To ſtand from 12 to one in the Pillory, one day at the place where the Fact was committed, another day over againſt <hi>Greys-Inn</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> and another at the May-pole in the <hi>Strand,</hi> with a Paper on his Hat ſignifying his Offence, and then to pay to the King 500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and be committed in Execution till paid, and then to find Sureties for his <hi>Good-Behaviour</hi> during Life.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>William Downing</hi> depoſed, that he printed part of that Book by her direction, to <hi>fol.</hi> 22. and then the Meſſenger found it, and ſome body elſe printed the reſt.</p>

Murther, aſcribing the Preſervation of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. at <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> wholly to the Papiſts; and from her Obſervation of the chiefeſt Sticklers for the Plot, being thoſe, or the Sons of thoſe that acted the principal Parts in the laſt Tragedy, ſhe doubted of its Truth, and therefore thought it her Duty through all ſorts of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, to relieve the poor impriſoned Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, which ſhe had done ſome Months, before ever ſhe ſaw the Counteſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> &amp;c. That on Thurſday <hi>Jan.</hi> 9, 1678, ſhe being in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> with five Women, of which three were Proteſtants; about four in the Afternoon they all heard terrible Groans and Squeeks which came out of the Dungeon, called the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Hole. She asked <hi>Harris</hi> the Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key what doleful Cry it was, who ſaid it was a Woman in Labour; ſhe deſired they might go to her and help her, but he drove them away rudely; but liſtning they ſoon found it was the Voice of a ſtrong Man in Torture, and heard as they thought between his Groans the winding up of ſome Engine. Theſe Cries
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:152694:76"/>ſtopt the Paſſengers under the Gate, and they ſix went to a Turners Shop without the Gate, and ſtood there amazed, when one of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Priſon came out in great haſte, ſeeming to run from the Noiſe, whom catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of, they asked him what the Noiſe meant? and whether it was not <hi>Prance</hi> upon the <hi>Rack?</hi> he ſaid he durſt not tell them, but was not able to hear any longer, running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way towards <hi>Holborn</hi> as faſt as he could. They heard theſe Groans perfectly to the end of the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> and they continued till near ſeven, and then a Perſon in the Habit of a Miniſter, of middle Stature, Grey-hair'd, accompanied with two other Men, went into the Lodg: The Priſoners were lock'd up, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Door of the Lodg alſo, at which ſhe ſet a Perſon to ſtand, and obſerve what ſhe could, and a Priſoner loaded with Irons was brought into the Lodg and examined a long time; and the Priſoners that came down as low as they could, heard the Perſon examined with great Vehemency, ſay often, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, I am innocent, he forced me to be-lie my ſelf: What would you have me ſay? Will you murder me becauſe I will not be-lie my ſelf and others? The Priſoners heard again the ſame Cry about four of the Clock the next Morning, and on Saturday-Morning again, and that Morning a Perſon emplyed to ſpy, ſeeing the <hi>Turn-key</hi> carry a Bed into the Dungeon, asked who it was for? he told her it was for <hi>Prance;</hi> who was gone mad, and had torn his Bed in pieces. That
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152694:77"/>Night the Examiners came again, and after an hours Conference, <hi>Prance</hi> was led away to the Preſs-yard. Soon after this <hi>Francis Corral,</hi> a Coach-Man, that had been put into <hi>Newgate</hi> upon ſuſpicion of carrying away Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfrey</hi>'s Body, and lay there thirteen weeks and three days in great Miſery, got out, whom ſhe went to ſee, and found him a ſad Spectacle, having the Fleſh worn away, and great holes in both his Legs by the weight of his Irons, and having been chained ſo long double, that he could not ſtand upright, who told her of his hard uſage, how he had been ſqueez'd and haſped into a thing like a Trough in a Dungeon under ground, inſomuch that he ſwoonded; and that a Perſon in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a Miniſter ſtood by all the while. That a Duke beat him, pull'd him by the Hair, and ſet his drawn Sword to his Breaſt three times, and ſwore he would run him through; and another great Lord laid down an heap of Gold, and told him it was 500 <abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> and that he ſhould have it all, and be taken into the aforeſaid Dukes Houſe, if he would confeſs what they would have him, and one <hi>F.</hi> a Vintner at the Half-Moon in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> by whoſe contrivance he was accuſed, took him aſide, and bid him name ſome Perſon, and ſay, they imployed him to take up the dead Body in <hi>Somerſet-yard,</hi> and gave him Mony for ſo doing, that if he would do this, both <hi>F.</hi> and he ſhould have Mony enough: And he alſo told her, that he was kept from Thurſday till Sunday without Victuals or Drink, having his Hands every
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:152694:77"/>Night chained behind him, and being all his time lock'd to a Staple driven into the Floor with a Chain not above a Yard long; that he was forced to drink his own Water, and the Jaylor beat his Wife becauſe ſhe brought Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, and pray'd he might have it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In another place of the Libel were theſe words read, <q>My Arraignment (which in confidence of my own Innocency I continually preſſed for) not but that I knew the danger, as to this Life, of encountring the Devil in the worſt of his Inſtruments, which are Perjurors, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to that degree as that profligated Wretch <hi>Thomas Dangerfield</hi> was, and has been ſince his being expoſed to the World in his true Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, both at mine, and anothers Trial.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in another place of the Libel. <q>Nor have I ſince received any thing towards my Loſſes, or the leaſt Civility from any of them, whilſt <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> when made a Priſoner for apparent Recorded Rogueries, was viſited by, and from Perſons of conſiderable Quality, with great Sums of Gold and Silver, to encourage him in the new Villanies he had undertaken, not againſt me alone, but Perſons in whoſe Safety all good Men, as well <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in the three Kingdoms are concerned.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> are theſe words, <q>And whenſoever his Majeſty pleaſes to make it as ſafe and honourable, as it is apparent it hath been gainful and meritorious to do the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there will not want Witneſſes to teſtify the Truth of more than I have written, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are above being made the Hangman's

               </p>
               <p>After thus much was read, Mr. Baron <hi>Weſton</hi> made ſome ſmart Reflections thereon, and then Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> depoſed, that he was uſed very civily in Priſon, and never ſaw any thing of Torture while he was in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and that Dr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> was with him many times, and if any ſuch thing had been, he would have ſeen it.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Francis Coral</hi> was called, but appeared not, and Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> informed the Court that they had got him away, but that his Wife was there, who being ſworn, depoſed that ſhe was not ſuffer'd to ſee her Husband in Priſon, and that ſhe heard that he was like to be ſtarved, and ſaw him with Irons on at length, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards holes in his Legs, but deny'd that ever ſhe was beat for bringing Victuals to him, and the Lord Mayor, Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> declared that her Husband had denyed all upon Oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> called two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to prove that ſhe ſent about for her Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in order to make her Defence, but that they could not be had in ſo ſhort time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired more time, and deſired the Court to confider ſhe was but a Woman, and that ſhe had ſuffered much for his Majeſty, and begged therefore Mercy in Juſtice. Then Mr. Baron <hi>Weſton</hi> ſumm'd up the Evidence, and the Jury returned her <hi>Guilty</hi> (at which there was a great ſhout) and ſo the Keeper carried her back to <hi>Newgate,</hi> from whence on Monday <hi>Sept.</hi> 13. ſhe was brought to the Bar, and Mr. <hi>Recorder</hi> gave
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:152694:78"/>the Judgment of the Court; which was that a 1000 <abbr>

               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Robert Bolron,</hi> being ſworn, depoſed, that in 1674. he came to live with Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoyne,</hi> and was Steward of his Colepits; and in 1675. he turned Papiſt; and about <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> 1676. Mr. <hi>Thwing,</hi> Father <hi>Ruſhton</hi> and ſeveral others came to his Houſe at <hi>Shippon,</hi> and did there examine him how he ſtood affected to the Roman Catholick Religion, and whether he was reſolved to venture his Life and Eſtate in it, if there were any occaſion? to which he agreed, and reſoved to obey his Ghoſtly Father in all things; and Father <hi>Ruſhton</hi> (his Confeſſor) gave him the Oath of Secreſy. — That in 1677. there was a Conſult at <hi>Barnborow</hi>-Hall, Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyne</hi>'s Houſe, in the old Dining-Room, Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoyne,</hi> the Lady <hi>Tempeſt, Thwing, Ruſhton</hi> and others, being preſent; wherein it was agreed, that the King ſhould be killed; and <hi>Thwing</hi> ſaid, that if they miſt this opportunity of doing it, they ſhould never have the like again; and the effecting of it would be very beneficial to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And in hopes this would ſucceed, they agreed, they would erect a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery at <hi>Dolebank,</hi> but their real Intention was to have it at <hi>Heworth</hi> (within a Mile of <hi>York</hi>) after the King was killed; and to avoid Suſpicion, the Lady <hi>Tempeſt</hi> promiſed them <hi>Broughton</hi> for the preſent, and <hi>Thwing</hi> was to be Confeſſor of the Nunnery for the preſent.—That he paid 10 <abbr>

                  </abbr> to <hi>Ruſhton</hi> in <hi>Thwing</hi>'s preſence towards killing the King, and ſaw a Liſt in <hi>Ruſhton</hi> and <hi>Thwing</hi>'s

                  </abbr> alſo to have his Soul prayed for. And <hi>Thwing</hi> told him afterwards, that in <hi>Yorkſhire, Lancaſhire</hi> and <hi>Derbyſhire,</hi> 30000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> was raiſed for the killing of the King, and that the Liſt was ſent beyond Sea.</p>
               <p>Againſt Mrs. <hi>Preſſicks</hi> he depoſed, That in 1678. ſhe told him, that ſhe being in <hi>London</hi> did hear a Woman cry after her, Stop the Papiſt, ſtop the Plotter, but ſhe got away, and afterwards durſt not appear publickly. That diſcourſing with her about the Plot, ſhe ſaid, Father <hi>Harcourt</hi> was her Confeſſor, and firſt engaged her in it; and that <hi>Pickering</hi> told her, he was to have killed the King; ſaying, ſhe was ſorry he did not; and that <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedloe</hi> were two Rogues, &amp; had it not been for them, the Plot had not been diſcovered. Telling him the Gun which was to have ſhot the King, was found with <hi>Pickering,</hi> which ſhe believed was the cauſe of his Death. And that ſhe ſaid the King was an Aſſe, and not fit to govern; that what Mony the Parliament gave him, he ſpent on Whores and Concubines.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Lawrence Mowbray</hi> depoſed, That about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1676. there was an Aſſembly of divers Prieſts in <hi>Ruſhton</hi>'s Chamber at <hi>Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borow</hi>-hall, whereat he was admitted, (he being one that waited upon <hi>Ruſhton</hi> at the Altar, and having took the Oath of Secrecy from him) and <hi>Thwing</hi> was there; he and <hi>Ruſhton</hi> manag'd the Conference, wherein they declared the King was an Heretick, and excommunicated by the Pope, and that he ſhould be killed, becauſe he had broke his Promiſe made to the Jeſuits, when he
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:152694:80"/>was beyond Sea; and that it was not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but meritorious to kill him.

Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation before Juſtice <hi>VVarcup;</hi> and that he knew nothing againſt Mrs. <hi>Preſſicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mrs. <hi>Bolron</hi> depoſed the ſame againſt Mrs. <hi>Preſſicks,</hi> of what ſhe had ſaid at Mr. <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>'s Houſe as before; adding, that ſhe ſaid there would never be quiet in <hi>England,</hi> till the Papiſts had got the upper hand, and not left a Proteſtant; and ſhe hoped an Army of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks would be raiſed to ſet up Popery.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Bolron</hi> jun. depoſed the ſame, being then alſo preſent.</p>
               <p>One <hi>John Hutchinſon</hi> was preſent too, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the ſame; adding that ſhe ſaid likewiſe, that we ſhould never be quiet till the D. of <hi>York</hi> was made King.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Thwing</hi> urged in his defence, that all this was only out of Malice to Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyne</hi>'s Family, to which he was related, and called Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nathaniel VVilſon</hi> ſaid, that about laſt <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> asked him if he could tell any thing of Father <hi>Ruſhton?</hi> and he told him no; then he bid him keep his Secrets, and he would give him more than he could earn in ſeven Years, but that unleſs he could ſhed the Blood of ſome of them, he ſhould get nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Lowther,</hi> the Juſtice who took Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi>'s Examination the 24th or 25th of <hi>June,</hi> 1679. teſtified, that he did not then mention <hi>Thwing.</hi>

                  <hi>Obediah Moor</hi> ſaid, that about laſt <hi>Candlemas</hi> was 12 Months, Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> told him, that Sir <hi>Tho. Gaſcoyne,</hi> nor none of his Family were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Plot, and that he believed there was no Plot. — But in <hi>Auguſt</hi> after, he told him he had but equivocated with him in what he ſaid before, and that there was a real Plot, and if he had ſworn a thouſand Lies he could have been forgiven them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stephen Tompſon</hi> teſtified that <hi>Bolron</hi> was arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Sir <hi>Tho. Gaſcoyne</hi> for Debt, to whom he was bound with him. When the Plot came out, he asked <hi>Bolron</hi> if Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was concerned? he ſaid no, he was as innocent as the Child un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born; but afterwards he ſaid, if Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> did ſue him, he would do him a greater Miſchief; and that while he intreated Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance for three Weeks, <hi>Bolron</hi> came up to <hi>London,</hi> and ſwore Treaſon againſt him; and as to Mrs. <hi>Preſſicks, Bolron</hi>'s Grandmother told him, ſhe could ſay nothing againſt her, but <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> ſaid ſhe muſt ſay ſo and ſo.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Zachary Thorpe</hi> teſtified that he meeting <hi>Bolron</hi> in <hi>Long-Acre,</hi> before the laſt Aſſizes, he told him Sir <hi>Tho. Gaſcoyne</hi> was cleared, but ſwore the Jury were Rogues.—And that he was now going down to the Aſſizes at <hi>York</hi> againſt the Lady <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> and ſwore he would ruin them; if one thing would not do, another ſhould do it. — And that <hi>Bolron</hi> would have had him been evidence againſt <hi>Shipton</hi> laſt Aſſizes. But Mr. Juſtice <hi>Dolben</hi> knowing this Witneſs, thought his Teſtimony very improbable.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>William Hardwick</hi> teſtified, that he being to carry Mrs. <hi>Preſſicks</hi> before Juſtice <hi>Lowther, Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>'s Wife ſaid ſhe was ſorry for it, for ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her to be an honeſt Woman, and had been a good Neighbour amongſt them.</p>

               <p>Then <hi>William Bacchus</hi> ſaid that when he ſerved a Warrant on the two Mrs. <hi>Bolron</hi>'s to go before Mr. <hi>Lowther,</hi> they ſaid they could ſay nothing againſt Six <hi>Tho. Gaſcoyne,</hi> nor any of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>

               <p>Then the Priſoner endeavoured to prove he was not at <hi>Barnborow-hall</hi> in 1677. by <hi>George Twiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> Groom to Sir <hi>Tho. Gaſcoyne,</hi> who could only ſay that he uſed to come there but a night or two in a Year.</p>

                  <hi>Joſeph Cooper</hi> ſaid, that about a Year ago he heard <hi>Mowbray</hi> ſay he knew nothing of the Plot, and that he believed Sir <hi>Tho.

               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:152694:82"/>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> being ſworn, gave a full relation of his Travels and Perverſion, and of what he had heard beyond Sea, and in <hi>England</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Plot. How Abbot <hi>Montague</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gaſcoyne</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and other Prieſts and Jeſuits told him, that if he would turn Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick he ſhould have Employment among them there, and afterwards <hi>England,</hi> for that they doubted not but the Popiſh Religion would come in very ſoon; and that becauſe (as the Abbot ſaid) they doubted not to procure a Toleration of Religion; and becauſe the Gentry that went abroad did obſerve the Novelty of their own Religion, and the Antiquity of theirs, and the Advantages that were to be had by it. But one Father <hi>Bennet</hi> and others ſaid, they doubted it not, becauſe their party was very ſtrong in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in a few Years they would bring it in right or wrong.</p>
               <p>That it was Cardinal <hi>Crimaldi</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him about 1671 to the Romiſh Religion at <hi>Provence;</hi> and that afterwards he lived ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Years in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jeſuits Colledg at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he hath often heard it diſputed, and preached and exhorted, that the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was an Heretick, and that there was no King really reigning, and whoever took him out of the way would do a meritorious Action, particularly by Father <hi>Anderton, Mumford Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> but chiefly <hi>Southwel,</hi> one of the chief of the Jeſuits. That when he came away thence for <hi>England,</hi> theſe Fathers for a whole Month, were exhorting that the King of <hi>England</hi> was not to be obeyed, and that in all private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:152694:83"/>all Perſons, who might be thought capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any deſign, were to be inſtructed, that they ſhould uſe all their Endeavours for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting Popery.—That while he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> he read <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters of Intelligence once a Month; and therein how the Duke, and the Queen, and the chief of the Nobility were of their ſide; how they carried matters ſeveral times; the ways the Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> and Sir <hi>VVilliam Godolphin</hi> did uſe to effect the work; and that they queſtion'd not to get the Lord <hi>Danby</hi> on their ſide too.—That when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into <hi>England,</hi> he found all the Popiſh Clergy in great hopes of Popery coining ſhortly in.— That he knew of Money gathered in the North, but refuſed to joyn therein.—That as to the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> he knew nothing, but that Sir <hi>Henry Calverley</hi> was turned out of Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Peace, through Complaint made to my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> of his being active againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. And that he writ to one <hi>Smith,</hi> that he would not make over his Eſtate as others did, for that he expected ſome ſudden Change or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.</p>
               <p>That the Cardinal, who perverted him, at the ſame time ſpoke of great Aſſurances that Popery, would prevail in <hi>England;</hi> that there was but one in the way, and tho that Man was a good natured Man, yet they could not ſo far prevail upon him, but that to accompliſh their deſigns they muſt take him out of the way. —That now he had been a Proteſtant two Years, and was always bred ſo till he travelled towards <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:152694:83"/>
               <p>After him Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was ſworn, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, That he had been acquainted with a Deſign of introducing Popery about 15 or 16 Years; and that he had ſeen ſeveral Letters from beyond-Sea, of Mony, Men and Arms being ready to Aſſiſt. That Collections of Mony were made in the Country, and 500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> paid to him ſo collected, which he paid to Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> to return to <hi>London,</hi> to diſcharge an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count count of Arms and Things received from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond-Sea, and for carrying on this Deſign.— That he himſelf had given them an Eſtate of 400 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> Value, and (becauſe he knew Mony would be wanting) had promis'd an 100 <abbr>

                  </abbr> more, as ſoon as the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> and he had accounted for this Deſign, and the praying for his Soul.—That the King of <hi>France</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his Aſſiſtance, and the Pope allowed ſome part of his Revenue for the ſame purpoſe.— That of late he had been at ſeveral Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; wherein the Death of the King was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, which was intended to be about <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, December,</hi> or <hi>January,</hi> 1678. and ſaw Letters from <hi>Paris</hi> which adviſed that it ſhould be thrown upon the Presbyterians, who had killed the old King, and were likelieſt to be thought to have done this, and ſo they might eaſily get the Proteſtants of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to join with the Papiſts againſt them, to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Proteſtantiſm, and accompliſhment of their Deſign.—That it was agreed, that the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> Sir <hi>James Symons,</hi> and others, ſhould go in <hi>October</hi> 1678. to diſpoſe of Arms, to the value he heard of 30000. <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr>—That after the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:152694:84"/>King had been killed, an Army was to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, to have cut off all that ſhould eſcape the Maſſacre, which alſo was deſigned.—That he bad been put upon to make Foot-Races to draw People together, that they might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have Diſcourſes together without ſuſpicion. —That he ſaw a Letter from the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> to Mr. <hi>Ewers,</hi> to ſhew, that things went on well beyond-Sea, and hoped they did ſo here: and that particularly the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was by at a Conſult, about <hi>September</hi> 1678. with Mr. <hi>Heve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham,</hi> Sir <hi>James Symonds,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vavaſor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Petre,</hi> Mr. <hi>Howard,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> about the Death of the King; and that Mr. <hi>Hevening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Sit <hi>James Symons,</hi> the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Draycott,</hi> Mr. <hi>Howard,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gerard</hi> did, of his knowledge contribute Mony for carrying on the Plot. That he ſaw a Letter from <hi>Whitebread,</hi> to give Mr. <hi>Ewers</hi> a Caution, to truſt only ſtout and truſty Fellows (no matter whether they were Gentlemen or no,) for killing of the King; and another Letter from <hi>Harcourt</hi> to <hi>Ewers,</hi> dated <hi>Octob.</hi> 12. and received the 14th, 1678, wherein it was ſaid, <hi>This night Sir Edmondbury Godfrey is diſpatched;</hi> the reaſon whereof was, <hi>Ewer</hi>'s ſaid, becauſe he had ſhewn himſelf too eager upon <hi>Oates</hi>'s Examination before him; and that therefore the Duke of <hi>York</hi> ſending to <hi>Coleman</hi> to deſire him not to reveal what be knew of the Plot; <hi>Coleman</hi> miſtruſting Sir <hi>Edmonbury,</hi> ſent word back, that it would be never the nearer, becauſe he had been ſo fooliſh as to reveal all to Sir <hi>E. Godfrey,</hi> who had promiſed to keep it all as a Secret, but that now he feared he would
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:152694:84"/>witneſs againſt him. Whereupon the Duke ſent word back again, That if he would but take care to conceal, he ſhould not come in againſt him; And upon this he was quickly diſpatched. —That be had oft been brought to the Oath of Secreſy, and the Sacrament, and particularly, when he withdrew, on a <hi>Monday,</hi> about the 18th or 19th of <hi>November,</hi> 1678, from the Lord <hi>Aſton's,</hi> when he carried all his Papers, and burnt them at a Neighbouring-houſe, becauſe he knew they would diſcover him and others concerned in the Plot; But afterwards under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch his Promiſes of Secrecy were better broke than kept, he came in to make his Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> depoſed, That in 1678, he went to one <hi>Singleton,</hi> a Prieſt, at one <hi>Hall's,</hi> a Cook in <hi>Ivy-Lane,</hi> who told him; That he did not fear, but in a little time to be a Prieſt in a Pariſh-Church; and that he would make no more to ſtab 40 Parliament-Men, than to eat his Dinner; which at that very time he was a doing.</p>
               <p>Then Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was ſworn, and told, how in the Year 1676, he was admitted Domeſtick Chaplain to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> being then a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> Where he became accquainted with ſome Popiſh Prieſts, and was told from one <hi>Singleton,</hi> That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion was upon it's laſt Legs; and it would become him, and all Men of his Coat, to haſten betimes home to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Having a ſtrong ſuſpicion ſome Years before, of the apparent growth of Popery, to ſatisfy his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:152694:85"/>Curioſity, he pretended ſome Doubts, and at laſt a Conviction by ſhe Jeſuits (becauſe he obſerved them, moſt able to inform him) and accordingly was reconciled on <hi>Aſhwenſday,</hi> 1676/7. Soon after, <hi>Strange</hi> (the then Provincial) told him, his Ordination was invalid, and he muſt become a Lay-man; then he deſiring to be of their Order, the Fathers, upon a Conſultation at <hi>Wild-Houſe,</hi> admitted him; and becauſe his Years were not ſuitable to be a novice, they propoſed travelling to him, to go beyond-Sea, and do their Buſineſs. This he accepted, and accordingly went <hi>April</hi> 1677, into <hi>Spain,</hi> to <hi>Validolid,</hi> having their Letters of Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; where he found Letters come from <hi>England</hi> before him, and dated in <hi>May,</hi> wherein was expreſſed, That the King was diſpatched, which cauſed great joy to the Fathers; but afterwards Letters dated the latter end of <hi>May</hi> came to certify their Miſtake, and to deſire the Fathers to ſtifle the News. Some Letters he opened alſo by the way, wherein was an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Diſturbance deſigned in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of the Hopes they had for carrying on the Catholick Cauſe in <hi>England.</hi> That in <hi>June</hi> Letters came thither, expreſſing, That <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingfield</hi> was made Confeſſor to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> whom they hoped would prevail much with him, in order to this Deſign; and that Letters from St. <hi>Omers</hi> dated the ſame Month, gave account, That Father <hi>Beddingfield</hi> had aſſured them of the Dukes willingneſs to comply with them.— That travelling through this Country, he found that Mony had been, there raiſed and ſent to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:152694:85"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> and particularly that the Provincial of the Jeſuits of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had advanced 10000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> promiſed to be paid in <hi>June</hi> following. That upon ſome Miſſioners arriving there in <hi>December,</hi> one <hi>Mumford,</hi> alias <hi>Armſtrong,</hi> preach'd, That the Oaths of Allegiance and Sumpremacy were Antichriſtian, Heretical, and Deviliſh, vilifying and abuſing the King's Legitimacy; ſaying, That his Religion intitled him to nothing but ſudden Death and Deſtruction.—In <hi>November</hi> he return'd for <hi>England,</hi> and coming into <hi>Strange</hi>'s Chamber, there was Father <hi>Keins</hi> lying ill upon <hi>Strange</hi>'s Bed, and <hi>Keins</hi> was ſaying, He was mighty ſorry for honeſt <hi>William</hi> (ſo they called <hi>Grove</hi> that was to kill the King) for miſſing in his Enterprize. They being more zealous for killing the King, after he had refuſed <hi>Coleman</hi> the Diſſolution of the Long Parliament. He came to St. <hi>Omers, December</hi> 9th or 10th N. S. and carried Letters from the Provincial, and other Fathers, wherein <hi>Strange</hi> told them, he had great hopes of effecting their Deſign next Year, but as yet they could not. That they had Letters from their New Provincial <hi>VVhite-bread,</hi> the ſame Year, to order <hi>Conyers</hi> to preach on St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury's</hi> day, ſaying he would be as zealous for carrying on of their Deſign as his Predeceſſor had been: In that Sermon <hi>Conyers,</hi> after he had commended the Saint, and declared how unworthily he was ſacrificed, did inveigh againſt the Tyranny (as he called it) of Temporal Prince, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the King of <hi>England;</hi>—Declaring that the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy were
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:152694:86"/>Antichriſtian and Deviliſh, and that it was fit to deſtroy all ſuch as would countenance them. In <hi>January</hi> they had Letters from <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the Reſolution of the Papiſts there to let in the French King, provided the Parliament ſhould urge the King, to break with <hi>France,</hi> and of their Zeal to vindicate their Freedom and their Religion from the oppreſſion, of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as they called it. In <hi>March</hi> Letters from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> gave account, That there had been a very ſhrewd Attempt made upon the Perſon of the King, and that the flint of <hi>Pickering</hi>'s Gun was looſe, and his Hand ſhaking the King did then eſcape, for which <hi>Pickering</hi> received a Diſcipline, and <hi>Grove,</hi> a Chiding. At the latter end of the ſame Months, 1678, came a Summons to a Conſutt, to which eight or nine came over, whereof the Witneſs was one. It began at the <hi>VVhite-Horſe</hi> Tavern, where they conſulted about ſome things of the Society, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adjourned into particular Societies, where they did debate and reſolve the Death of the King, and that <hi>Grove</hi> ſhould have 1500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> for his pains; and <hi>Pickering,</hi> a Religious Man, 30000 Maſſes.—Preſently after he returns to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and after him the New Provincial, who ordered him back again to <hi>England,</hi> where he arrived at <hi>Dover, June</hi> 14, meeting there with <hi>Fenwick,</hi> with whom he came to <hi>London</hi> the 17th. Letters arriving juſt after them, wherein were Propoſals to be made to Sir <hi>Geo. VVakeman</hi> for poiſoning of the King, and that the 10000 <abbr>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:152694:86"/>him. <hi>Coleman</hi> thought it too little, <hi>Langhorn</hi> too much, ſaying he was a narrow-ſpirited Soul, and that he ought to do ſo great a piece of Service for nothing. There was 5000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> of it paid him, as he ſaw entred in the Books; and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Aſhby</hi> in <hi>July</hi> renewed the Propoſal of 15000 <abbr>

                  </abbr> and <hi>Fenwick,</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi> gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the Provincial of it's being accepted of.

In <hi>July</hi> he diſcover'd to Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> of which the King had Notice 13th or 14th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and by the 3d of <hi>September</hi> he was betray'd, and expoſed to the Vengeance of the Papiſts, whoſe Plot he had thus Diſcovered.</p>
               <p>Then to fortify Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Evidence, Mr. <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> was called, who depoſed, That he ſaw Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> at <hi>Vallidolid</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and related what Diſcourſe they had together, and how they came acquainted; and how the Doctor lent him Mony to defray the Expence of his Journey, and ſent a Letter by him to <hi>Madrid,</hi> which he heard read, and related the Contents of it.—That he had both heard of, and ſeen Mony collected in <hi>Ireland,</hi> naming the Collectors thereof, in the Year, 1668, for the encouragement of the French King to bring in an Army thither; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging himſelf to be now a Dominican Fryer, and a Papiſt.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> being ſworn, depoſed, That in 1678, he had heard Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Jenniſon,</hi> his Brother, both Jeſuits, ſpeak of a Deſign to get a Toleration, by bribing the then Parliament, by a great Sum of Mony pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from their Party: And of ſecuring the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Succeſſion, by getting Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be granted out to the Papiſts to be ready to riſe upon the Death of the King; ſaying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, their Religion could never flouriſh, till the Government was altered to the French Model. In <hi>June</hi> 1678, he heard Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> ſay, in his own Chamber, That Popery was like to come into <hi>England,</hi> and there was but one ſtood in the way; that it was an eaſy thing to poiſon the King, and that Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> might eaſily and opportunely do it.

                  <p>Then <hi>Dugdale</hi> being called again, was by him charged, That He had ſworn at Sir <hi>George Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Trial, that he (the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>) was at a Conſult at <hi>Tixal,</hi> in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1678, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it by the Teſtimony of the Lady Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and one Mrs. <hi>Howard,</hi> who affirm'd they heard him (though <hi>Dugdale</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it); and then proved that he was all that Month at the <hi>Bath;</hi> and at the Marqueſs of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>'s Houſe, by <hi>Thomas Bonny</hi> Clerk of the Kitchen to the Lord Marqueſs, of <hi>Worceſter, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas White</hi> his Coachman, <hi>Richard Bevan</hi> his Groom, and the Lord Marqueſs himself; and that he came not to <hi>Tixal</hi> till <hi>Septemb.</hi> 12. and then had no Converſe alone with <hi>Dugdale,</hi> nor could ever endure him; reviling him, as having been a poor Boy found at the Door, then a Threſher, then a Baily, and now a Witneſs for the King.

                  <p>Then the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> proceeded to prove, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> depoſed, at the Trial of the five
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:152694:91"/>Jeſuits, That he communicated the News of Sir <hi>E.

And Mr. <hi>Sambidge</hi> denied that he heard of the News till Friday or Saturday, or that he was at the Ale-houſe with <hi>Dugdale</hi> at all; but that he was an ill Man, and very abuſive, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Clergy.</p>
                  <p>Then the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> proceeded againſt Dr. <hi>Oates;</hi> objecting againſt him, That when he was examin'd before the Council, having named many, and not naming the Priſoner, he ſaid, he had no more to accuſe; and for the proof of this he call'd Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd,</hi> who remembred nothing of it, and appealed to the Lords then preſent, but none could ſpeak to it; till at length the Earl of <hi>Berkley</hi> did ſay, That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, in the Houſe of Lords, when Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was asked, If he could accuſe any other Perſon of what Quality ſoever? <hi>Oates</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That he had no more in relation to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to accuſe, but in relation to <hi>Ireland</hi> he had; which was after he had accuſed the Lord <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> though before he had accuſed the Queen.</p>
                  <p>Then he called for Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> again, and objected further againſt him, That he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe before <hi>Tho. Lane</hi> and <hi>J.

That preſently after one <hi>Howard,</hi> Almoner to the Queen, went beyond-Seas, he was told by <hi>Geo. Hobſon,</hi>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:152694:91"/>(Servant to the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>) that there was a Deſign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas this <hi>Hobſon</hi> was not a Servant to the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> of three Years after the Almoner went, and yet here he ſays preſently. But <hi>Dugdale</hi> explained, that his meaning was, that <hi>Hobſon</hi> told him there was a Deſign preſently after the Almoner went, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which was conteſted, but at laſt ſubmitted to.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Turbervile</hi> was called again; and the Priſoner objected againſt him his depoſing to the Year 1673 one day, and to 1672 the next; whence he concluded him to be neceſſarily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured: But Sir <hi>William Poultney,</hi> who took his Affidavit, related the whole Story, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be miſtaken in the Year; which he finding out that Night, by a Paper he found, came and corrected it himſelf the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And whereas the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him for a Coward, and for running away from his Colours, he produced his Diſcharge from his Captain, which certified otherwiſe. Then whereas <hi>Turbervile</hi> had before depoſed, that his Lordſhip was lame of the Gout, when he waited upon him in <hi>France,</hi> he declared he had not been lame theſe forty Years, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the Gout in his Life; and his two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>Furneſs</hi> and <hi>Leigh,</hi> teſtified the ſame for the time they had lived with him, and who were with him then in <hi>France,</hi> but denied that ever they ſaw <hi>Turbervile</hi> with him. And whereas <hi>Turbervile</hi> depoſed, That he came to <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Calice,</hi> he ſaid, he came by <hi>Diep,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced one Mr. <hi>Wyborne</hi> who teſtified the ſame,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:152694:92"/>together with his aforeſaid two Servants. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whereas <hi>Turbervil</hi> depoſed, That when he came from. <hi>Doway,</hi> his Relations were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him, and the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> and his Lady; he affirmed, that he was upon his return, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived courteouſly at the Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s Houſe, and by his Relations; which was teſtified by <hi>John Minhead,</hi> one that belonged to the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> and a French-Man. And whereas <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervile</hi> ſaid he was diſinherited; his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by another Mother, teſtified the kindneſs of his Relations towards him, and that there was no Eſtate likely ever to come to him, there being ſo many Heirs before him. Finally, whereas <hi>Turbervile</hi> alſo, in his Affidavit had ſaid, the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> was at the Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s at ſuch a time, which muſt be either in the Years 1672, 1673, or 1674, he called Mr. <hi>Lydcott</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to teſtify he was not in <hi>Wales</hi> in any of thoſe Years, who by his Notes, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he had tranſcribed out of another Book, ſpoke very particularly to the times; only the beginning of 1672, he could not tell how to account for; nor did <hi>Turbervile</hi> ever ſay poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to a Year.</p>
                  <p>So the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> being asked if he had any more Witneſſes? and anſwering he had three or four, the Peers thought it too late to proceed, and ſo adjourned into the Parliament-Chamber, and the Commons went back to their Houſe; to whom the Lords ſent a Meſſage, that they had ordered the Priſoner again to the Bar at Ten next Morning.</p>

That alſo he and Mr. <hi>Hanſon</hi> was at <hi>Eld</hi>'s the Ale-houſe, <hi>Oct.</hi> 14. on Monday Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and heard Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> tell of the Murther of a Juſtice of Peace of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mr. <hi>Phillips,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sambidg,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have denied it, and <hi>Hanſon</hi> being called again, depoſed the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Birch</hi> alſo depoſed, that it was all about thoſe parts by Tueſday and Wedneſday, <hi>Octob.</hi> 15, and 16. that a Juſtice of Peace of <hi>Middleſex</hi> was killed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Turton</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> depoſed that he was told of the Rumor on Tueſday, <hi>Octob.</hi> 15. and that it was Sir <hi>Edm. Godfrey</hi> that was murthered, and as it was ſuppoſed, by the Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>Then againſt the Teſtimony of <hi>William Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> a Member of the Houſe of Commons, depoſed that he heard him in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> talk the moſt atheiſtically as ever he heard any Man in his Life, ridiculing the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> it being on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> and that from others he had heard how he went about the Country to cheat.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Macclesfield</hi> depoſed, much to the ſame purpoſe, and that he had heard him confeſs himſelf a Rogue, and falſe Dice were
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:152694:94"/>found about him, being before a Juſtice of Peace.</p>
                  <p>Againſt <hi>Samuel Holt,</hi> another of the Priſoner's Witneſſes, <hi>Sampſon Rawlins,</hi> depoſed, that he was a Man of a very ill Report where he lived, a lewd drunken Fellow, and ſaid to keep ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Wife, and that he ſaid none but Rogues would take Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s part and be cauſe the Witneſs did ſo, he would have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him, and that he broke the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Wine-Celler, and my Lord bid Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſend him to Goal, but he begg'd him his Pardon; that he had known Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> this 14 or 15 Years in good Repute and an honeſt Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Launder</hi> depoſed much to the ſame purpoſe againſt <hi>Holt,</hi> adding that he was, by a Conſult of them at <hi>Tixal,</hi> proffer'd Mony to have ſworn <hi>Anſelm</hi> a perjured Rogue at the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Trial.</p>
                  <p>Againſt <hi>John Morrall, Thomas Thorne</hi> depoſed, that he was a poor needy Fellow, that wandred about the Country, and but of an indifferent Reputation.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Simon VVright</hi> depoſed, that one <hi>Pleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington</hi> had proffer'd him 700 <abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> to own himſelf perjured at Mrs. <hi>Price</hi>'s Trial, and to ſwear that <hi>Dugdale</hi> would have given him Money to ſwear againſt Sir <hi>James Simons</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gerard,</hi> and they made him write Letters to this purpoſe; this <hi>Pleſſington</hi> was the Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi>'s Steward.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Elizabeth Eld</hi> depoſed, that ſhe and her Siſter help'd to burn Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Papers that Morning he went away from the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s, and one little Book he ſaid had no Treaſon in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:152694:94"/>it, and needed not therefore to be burnt; Why, ſaid the Witneſs, is there Treaſon in any of the other Papers? to which he only anſwered, Do you think there is?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ann Eld,</hi> her Siſter, depoſed alſo the very ſame things.</p>
                  <p>Then one Mr. <hi>Michael Noble,</hi> depoſed that he had help'd him to make up his Accounts, and been with Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> at the <hi>Tower,</hi> to account with the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> twice, and one time the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> would not be ſpoke with, and another time they ſpake with him with great difficulty, but he would not produce the Book wherein Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſaid the Diſcharges were.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi> depoſed he was with Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> at the <hi>Tower,</hi> when he went to make up his Accounts with him, but they could not be admitted; and that then he heard one of the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Men ſay, that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was as honeſt a Gentleman as ever lived in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Nich. Boſon,</hi> who was with Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> at the ſame time with Mr. <hi>Noble</hi> and Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> depoſed to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Then for the Vindication of <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, <hi>Thomas Whitby,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> depoſed that he had known Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> nine or ten Years in the Ld. <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Service, and that he was his Steward, and all the Servants under him, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with all his Eſtate, and counted faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Maſter's Intereſt, only he hath heard ſome Tradeſmen ſay that he hath put them off without Mony.</p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:152694:95"/>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>William Southall,</hi> a Coroner of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> was ſworn, who teſtified to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Dugdale,</hi> having known him eight Years, and gave a large account of his firſt Diſcovery of the Plot, being then preſent, how that on <hi>December</hi> 23, 1678. he meeting Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> at <hi>Stafford</hi> upon buſineſs, he perſwaded him to diſcover, and got him examin'd that day, and afterwards more fully the next day.</p>
                  <p>After him one Mr. <hi>Thomas Mort,</hi> who had been Page to the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> depoſed that he ſaw <hi>Turbervile</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and knew he convers'd with the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> whom he knew not, and came with him to <hi>Diep,</hi> to go over with him and my Lord, for whom they waited a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, much to their Inconveniency; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he or ſome of the Company ſaid, <hi>Curſed is he that relies on a broken Staff,</hi> alluding to the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Name. That <hi>Turbervile</hi> then told him, if he went to <hi>Calice,</hi> he might go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with my Lord, but how he came to know that, he knew not; but he got another opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſo came over.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Powel,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Greys-Inn,</hi> depoſed, that he heard him mention his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg about the Plot about a Year ago, but that he did not think fit then to reveal it, for fear of his Brother's Anger, and becauſe ſome of the Witneſſes had been diſcouraged, and he was afraid he ſhould be ſo too.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> (one of the Members of the Houſe of Commons) depoſed that he knew Mr. <hi>Turbervile</hi> to be a very civil honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that the reaſon he diſcover'd no
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:152694:95"/>ſooner was, he told him, becauſe the Witneſſes that were come in were in danger of their Lives, and were diſcouraged, and as long as the D. of <hi>York</hi> had ſo great a Power in the Council, and the Lady <hi>Powis</hi>'s Brother in thoſe Parts he lived (which his Lordſhip uſually calls his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince) he durſt not for his Life.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Hobby</hi> being ſworn, gave a very good Character alſo of Mr. <hi>Turbervile,</hi> whom he had known four Years.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Matthews,</hi> a Divine, being ſworn, gave him likewiſe a good Character, and that he had often diſcourſed with him, and found him incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to come off from the Roman Religion, and that he had known him four Years.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>William Seys</hi> being ſworn, ſaid, he never heard nor knew any ill by Mr. <hi>Turbervile,</hi> whom he had known two Years.</p>
                  <p>Captain <hi>Scudamore</hi> depoſed much the ſame as to Mr. <hi>Turbervile</hi>'s Credit.</p>
                  <p>Then whereas the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> had brought his Servants to prove he had not been lame of ſo long a time; the Lords <hi>Stamford</hi> and <hi>Lovelace</hi> depoſed that they had obſerved him lame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in leſs than ſeven Years, which his Lordſhip ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, ſaying it was only his Wearineſ.</p>
                  <p>And here the Managers reſolving to call no more Witneſſes, urged the Priſoner to ſum up his Defence, that the Proceſs might be cloſed. But he called Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> again, asking him if he had not once complained of <hi>Dugdale</hi> to the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> telling him he was a Knave? Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> confeſſed he told the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was a Diſhonour to his Family, in not paying
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:152694:96"/>People their Mony, when they came for it. But he was told afterwards, it ſignified nothing, for that the preſent Ld. <hi>Aſton</hi> would hear nothing againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Then the Ld. <hi>Stafford</hi> gave into the Court <hi>Wright</hi>'s Letter; who being called, owned his hand, ſaying, That was one which he was hired to write; which intimated as if <hi>Dugdale</hi> had ſuborned him to ſwear falſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then the Priſoner being urged to conclude, he proteſted his Unreadineſs and Weakneſs; whereupon the Court broke up, and the Lords ſent a Meſſage to the Commons, that to morrow morning at 10, they had ordered the Priſoner again to the Bar.</p>

                  <head>The fifth Day.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>SAturday December</hi> the 4th, 1680. About 10, the Court being ſat, and the Priſoner call'd upon to ſum up his Defence, he prayed leave to call a few Witneſſes more, which after ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and his Lordſhips Weeping, was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And then the Lord <hi>Ferrers</hi> was called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſpeak his Knowledg of <hi>Southall;</hi> who ſaid he could only ſpeak by hear-ſay, that he had been an active Man in the late times againſt the King, and is counted a pernicious Man againſt the Government.</p>
                  <p>The Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> alſo was called, and teſtify'd that <hi>Dugdale</hi> coming to make up his Accounts, the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> deſired the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be preſent, who ſaid he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Accounts, but would get one that did; whereupon <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſaid he would come another
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:152694:96"/>time, but never did that he ſaw or heard of.</p>
                  <p>The Priſoner began to ſum up his Defence; and ended with propoſing theſe five Points of Law. 1ſt. That there is no precedent for cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Proceedings to be continued from Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Parliament, as this had been to three. <hi>2ly.</hi> Whether in capital Caſes, they can proceed upon Impeachment, and by Indictment firſt found by the Grand Jury. <hi>3ly.</hi> There is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Impeachment, there being no overt Act alledged. <hi>4ly.</hi> The Witneſſes by Law are not competent, becauſe they ſwear for Mony. And not having proved him a Papiſt, whether he can be concern'd as to the Plot in general. <hi>5ly.</hi> That there ought to be two Witneſſes to every point. Thus concluding, the Managers vindicated Mr. <hi>Southall</hi>'s Credit ſufficiently, by the Depoſitions of the Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Leveſon-Gower,</hi> who knew him very well to be an honeſt able good Man, and of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and an eager Proſecutor of Papiſts. Then Sir <hi>William Jones,</hi> one of the Managers, ſumm'd up the Evidence very largely, and Mr. <hi>Powle</hi> another of them, proceeded, and Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> anſwered his matters in Law ſhewing to the third ſeveral Overt Acts, as receiving a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, being at Conſults, and hiring Perſons to kill the King. To the 2d, That an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Houſe of Commons is more than an Indictment. To the 1ſt, That what is once upon Record in Parliament, may at any time be proceeded upon. And then Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> ſpoke again: And to the 5th, ſaid, there needed but one Witneſs to one Act, and another to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:152694:97"/>where the ſeveral Acts as here, fall under the ſame head of Treaſon. And to the 4th, that he had not proved, and however that what Mony the Witneſſes had, was for their Maintenance only. Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> ſpoke alſo to the ſame heads. And then the Priſoner urged that his Counſel might be heard as to thoſe Points; who were Mr. <hi>VVallop,</hi> Mr. <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> and the firſt propoſed to be handled, being the laſt; Mr. <hi>VVallop</hi> excuſed himſelf from ſpeaking to it, becauſe it lately had been determin'd in the inferiour Courts, — Then the Lords adjourned into the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Chamber to conſider the Points, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſtaying, and returning after about an hour, the Lord High Steward, declared that it was the Lords Will that all the Judges preſent ſhould give their Opinions, whether the 5th Point was doubtful and diſputable or no. Then all the Judges conſulted privately together, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gave their Opinions (in the Negative) <hi>Seriatim;</hi> firſt the Ld. Ch. Juſtice <hi>North,</hi> (the Ld. Ch.

H. <hi>Steward</hi> told him the Lords had granted. He then ſaid, that ſeeing he had received their Order that his Counſel ſhould not be heard touching the continuance of Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from Parliament to Parliament, he deſired that he might offer them his own Conceptions concerning that; urging that they had not yet declared their own Judgments either as to that, or whether they did acquieſce in the Judges Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; praying that his Counſel might be heard as to the other points: proteſting his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and Abhorrency of Treaſon: reading then his Caſe, and repeating his Defence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After which the Lords adjourned into the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Chamber, and the Commons returned to their Houſe, and received a Meſſage from the Lords, that they had ordered the Priſoner to the Bar to receive Judgment to morrow at 10.</p>

                  <p>Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> Duke of <hi>Cumberland;</hi> Guilty upon my Honour.</p>
                  <p>The Ld. H. Steward then declared, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on telling the Votes, he found there were 31 that think the Priſoner <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and 55 that have found him Guilty. Whereupon the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:152694:99"/>was brought to the Bar; and the Ld. High Steward informing him, the Lords had found him <hi>Guilty:</hi> He ſaid, <hi>God's Holy Name be praiſed for it!</hi> —confeſſing it ſurpriz'd him, for he did not expect it; and that he had only this to ſay for ſuſpending of Judgment, That he did not hold up his Hand at the Bar, which he conceived he ought to have done; and that though he was tried upon the Act of 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. yet there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing more in that Act, than what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Act of the 13th of this King, he ought only to loſe his Seat in Parliament, which was the Puniſhment there put down for a Peer; ſubmitting to their Lordſhips, and deſiring their Judgments in theſe Points.</p>
                  <p>Then the Lords Adjourned into the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Chamber, and the Committee of Commons returned to their own Houſe; and the Speaker having re-aſſumed the Chair, the whole Body of the Houſe went, with their Speaker, to the Bar of the Houſe of Lords, to demand Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of High-Treaſon againſt <hi>William</hi> Viſcount <hi>Stafford,</hi> upon the Impeachment of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament, in the Name of the Commons in Parliament, and of all the Commons of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Commons, with their Speaker, went back to their Houſe. Then the Lords took into Conſideration what Judgment was to be given, and it was moved that he might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed. After ſome Debate the Judges were asked, Whether if any other Judgment than the uſual Judgment for High-Treaſon were given upon him, it would attaint his Blood?
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:152694:100"/>The Judges were of Opinion, that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for High-Treaſon appointed by Law, is to be Drawn, Hang'd, and Quartered; and in the Courts and proceedings below, they can take no notice of any Judgment for High-Treaſon, but that.</p>
                  <p>Then Sir <hi>Creſwell Levinz,</hi> deſired for the King (being his Attorney-General) to have that Judgment; becauſe if any other were given, it would be prejudicial to his Majeſty, and be a Queſtion in the inferior Courts as to his Attainder of High-Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>So it was ordered, that the ordinary Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be pronounc'd upon him; Which (their Lordſhips and the Commons being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and the Court, ſate) was accordingly by the Lord High Steward; he premiſing a ſhort pithy Speech, wherein he acquainted him, that what he had ſaid in Arreſt of Judgment had been found by the Lords, to be of no moment at all: ſpeaking to the certainty of the Plot, and of his ſhare therein, adviſing now to conſider how God had left him, and that he never leaves any but who leave him firſt. To think what kind of Religion it is, wherein he had been led to this; And to conſider that true Repentance was never too late, moving him to give God the Glory, by a free Confeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After Sentence pronounc'd, the Priſoner, deſired his Relations and Friends might come to him. And the Lord H. <hi>Steward</hi> inform'd him that the Lords intended to become humble Suitors to his Majeſty to remit all the Puniſhment but the taking off his Head. The Priſoner
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:152694:100"/>weeping, anſwered, <hi>That their Juſtice did not make him cry, but their Goodneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Lord High Steward broke his Staff, and the Lords Adjourned into the Parliament-Chamber, and the Commons returned to their Houſe, and the Priſoner, with the Ax born before him, with the Edg towards him (it being carried contrarily during his Trial) was ſent back to the Tower.</p>
                  <p>On Wedneſday, <hi>December</hi> 29. 1680. About 10 in the Morning, he was brought to the Scaffold on <hi>Tower-Hill.</hi> And pulling off his Hat, he pulled a Paper out of his Pocket and read it, as his Speech (which the very ſame day, before two a Clock, came out in Print, as his Speech) and he delivered divers Copies, ſigned by himſelf, to Mr. Sheriff <hi>Corniſh,</hi> and other Gentlemen about him. He then deſired he might have liberty to pray in his own Way; which being granted, he kneeled down by the Block, and taking out of his Pocket another Paper, he read a Latin Prayer; which done, he gave the Paper to Mr. Sheriff <hi>Bethel;</hi> and then ſpoke to the People about the Scaffold to this effect: <hi>God bleſs you all, Gentlemen; God preſerve his Majeſty, He is as good a Prince as ever govern'd you; Obey him as faithfully as I have done; and God bleſs you all Gentlemen.</hi> Then he ſtrip's himſelf to his Waſtcoat, and after ſome few ſhort private Diſcourſes with his Friends, he laid down his Neck on the Block, and ſtretched himſelf. The Executioner being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Sheriffs, whether he had any Sign? he anſwered, No. Then the Priſoner
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:152694:101"/>raiſed up his Head, and ſaid, He had no Sign to give, but the Executioner might take his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; and laid his Neck on the Block again. After which, in a ſhort time, the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner did his Office, by ſevering his Head from his Body, and holding up the Head in his Hand, carried it about the Scaffold, ſhewing it to the People and ſaying <hi>Here is the Head of a Traitor.</hi> The Body was put into a Coffin, and conveyed to the <hi>Tower.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>ON Wedneſday, <hi>April</hi> 27. 1681. the Grand Juries for the County of <hi>Middleſex</hi> were ſworn and after the Charge delivered by Mr. Juſtice <hi>Jones,</hi> His Majeſty's Attorney General deſired, That ſome of that Grand Jury which ſerved for the Hundreds of <hi>Edmondton</hi> and <hi>Gore</hi> might be preſent at the ſwearing of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, upon an Indictment for High-Treaſon, to be preferred againſt <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> which was granted; But the Grand Jury being under ſome Scruples againſt receiving of the Bill, deſired the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Court therein; which Mr. Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> alone thought not fit to give, but ordered them to attend next day when the Court was full.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:152694:101"/>
               <p>Accordingly on Thurſday, <hi>April</hi> 28. the ſaid Grand Jury came to the Bar, and Mr. <hi>Michael Godfrey</hi> (Brother to Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfrey</hi>) who was their Foreman, requeſted the Court, that before they proceeded upon this Indictment, that this ſame. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> might be examin'd about his Brother's Death, of which he was ſuppoſed to know much, and preſented a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (which the Jury own'd) which deſired the Opinion of the Court, Whether it was ſafe for them to meddle with the Indictment of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> becauſe he was impeached by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſe of Commons; which Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being not received, it was voted by them in their Houſe, That he ſhould not be tried by any other Inferior Gourt?—To which the Ld. Ch. Juſtice <hi>Pemberton</hi> reply'd, that it was the Opinion of all the Judges, who had aſſembled to debate this Matter for their ſatisfaction, that they ought not to take notice of any of theſe things, but to proceed upon this Indictment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Evidence. After which the Jury went away, and found the Bill.</p>
               <p>On Friday <hi>April</hi> 29 Serjeant <hi>Stringer</hi> moved for an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to bring up <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> to be examined by the Court about the Death of Sir <hi>E. Godfrey;</hi> The Court granted the Writ, And ſaid, he ſhould be Arraigned upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment againſt him, and then they would examin him.</p>
               <p>On Saturday, <hi>April.</hi> 30. <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris</hi> was brought, with a ſtrong Guard, to the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> Court; Where deſiring to plead to the Juriſdiction of the Court, he put in his Plea;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:152694:102"/>which was read, (the ſubſtance of it being, what the Grand Jury's Petition had expreſs'd, about his being Impeached by the Commons) which not being ſign'b by any Counſel, the Court refus'd; and upon his Requeſt, aſſign'd him Sir <hi>Francis Winnington,</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wallop,</hi>(giving to Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, <hi>May</hi> 4.) to prepare his Plea. After which The Priſoner being carried away to be examined, was then return'd to the Tower.</p>
               <p>On Monday, <hi>May</hi> 2. Sir <hi>Francis Winnington,</hi> and the other three of Counſel for Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> came to the Bar, and moved the Court for an Explanation of the Rule concerning themſelves, and the Buſineſs they were aſſigned for; Praying for longer time to draw up the Plea, and for a Copy of the Indictment; Both which were denied them. And, upon Mrs. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Motion, Sir <hi>William Jones,</hi> Sir <hi>Geo. Treby,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> were added to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Counſel; and leave given for a Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to carry Papers to and: fro in the preſence of the Lieutenant. Mr. <hi>VVallop</hi> deſired Counſel might be aſſigned in his place, becauſe of the ſhortneſs of the time allowed them; but it could not be granted.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, <hi>May</hi> 4. the Priſoner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, put in his <hi>Plea;</hi> the which Mr. Attorn. Gen. Mr. Sol. Gen. Serj. <hi>Maynard,</hi> Serj. <hi>Jefferies</hi> Sir. <hi>Francis VVithins,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sanders</hi> (being the King's Counſel) uſed great endeavours to have over-ruled, without ſo much as hearing the Priſoners Counſel for the maintaining it; for that they ſaid it was nought, becauſe it
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:152694:102"/>produced no Record of his Impeachment, and did not ſpecify what the High-Treaſon was for which he was Impeached; and that the King had Power to proceed on an Impeachment or Indictment for the ſame thing at his Election.— Nevertheleſs the Attorny General demurred, and the Priſoner joined in the Demurrer. And then, after much arguing, a Day was given to argue the Plea till Saturday, <hi>May.</hi> 7. At which time the Attorny General added to the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he took to the Plea, Whether a Suit in a Superior Court, can take away the Juriſdiction of the Cauſe, of the Perſon, and of the Fact, at the time of the Fact committed?</p>
               <p>To maintain the Plea, Mr. <hi>VVilliams</hi> (of Counſel for the Priſoner) in a very long and learned Diſcourſe, firſt ſpoke, ſtating the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Caſe upon the Indictment, the Plea to the Indictment, and the Demurrer to the Plea: Alledging the Difference of an Impeachment from an Indictment; and offering ſome Reaſons why this Court ought not to proceed upon this Indictment. Then anſwering diſtinctly, Mr. Attorney's Exceptions to the Plea; producing ſome Preſidents, of this Courts Proſecution being ſtop'd by Pleas to the Juriſdiction, ſhewing what had been done upon thoſe Pleas, What Doom they had: Laying before the Court the Right of the Commons to Impeach in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Judicature of the Lords to determine that Impeachment, and the Method, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of Parliament, ſubmitting it to them, how far they would lay their Hands on this Caſe, thus circumſtantiated.</p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:152694:103"/>
               <p>Here the Ld. Ch. Juſtice declared, That all theſe Things were quite foreign to the Caſe, and the Matter in Hand only was, Whether this Plea as thus pleaded, was ſufficient to protect the Priſoner, from being queſtioned in this Court, for the Treaſonable Matter in the Indictment before them?—To which Mr. <hi>VVilliams</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, That 'twas an hard matter for the Bar to anſwer the Bench.</p>
               <p>After which Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> pleaded, That he conceived that it was confeſſed by the Demurrer, that there is an Impeachment by the Commons of <hi>England</hi> of High-Treaſon againſt <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> lodged in the Houſe of Lords, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum Legem &amp; conſuetudinem Parliamenti.</hi> And that the Treaſon for which he was impeached, is the ſame Treaſon contained in the Indictment; So that now the general Queſtion was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Impeachment for Treaſon, by the Houſe of Commons, and ſtill depending, were a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Matter to ouſt the Court from proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon an Indictment for the ſame Offence? Which he learnedly endeavoured to make good, by ſeveral Reaſons as well as Preſidents.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Wallop</hi> pleaded next, on the ſame ſide; whoſe Province was to prove, That the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Impeachment, and in the Indictment, was the ſame, and that this was well averred in the Plea.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> pleaded, That a general Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment in Parliament, was a good Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Judges had declared ſo to the King and Council, concerning the five Popiſh Lords; who could not therefore be tried upon
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:152694:103"/>Indictments, ſo long as general Impeachments were depending for the ſame Treaſon; and that therefore this Plea was good, both as to Matter and Form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In reply to vitiate the Plea, it was inſiſted on by Mr. Attorn. Gen. Mr. Sol. Gen. Serj. <hi>Jeffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis VVithens,</hi> (of Counſel for the King) that the Plea concluded not in the uſual Form; That perhaps this Matter, if the Priſoner had been acquitted upon the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might have been pleaded in Bar to the Indictment, but it was not pleadable to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Court: That in the Caſe of the five Lords, the Indictments were removed into the Houſe of Lords; and that the Judges Opinion given at the Council-Board, was not a Judicial Opinion, nor did any way affect this Cauſe.</p>
               <p>After which the Ld. Ch. Juſtice thought fit not to give preſent Judgment, but to take time for Deliberation.—Whereupon the Priſoner was carried back to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And on Tueſday, <hi>May</hi> 10. Mr. Attorney mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Court to appoint a Day for their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Plea, and for <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> to be brought up; which they appointed to be the next Morning.</p>
               <p>Accordingly on Wedneſday Morning, <hi>May</hi> 11. the Priſoner being brought to the Bar, the Ld. Ch. Juſtice deliver'd the Opinion of the Court, upon Conference had with other Judges, That his Brother <hi>Jones,</hi> his Brother <hi>Raymond,</hi> and himſelf; were of Opinion that the Plea was inſufficient, his Brother <hi>Dolben</hi> not being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:152694:104"/>but doubting concerning it; and therefore awarded the Priſoner ſhould plead to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment; which he did, <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and his Trial ordered to be the next Term.</p>

               <p>To whom the Indictment was read; which was, for High-Treaſon, in conſpiring the Death of the King, and ſubverſion of the Government, the which Mr. <hi>Heath,</hi> Serj. <hi>Maynard,</hi> and Mr. Attorn. Gen. opened.</p>
               <p>And then Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> depoſed, How the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner was with him on Monday, <hi>Feb.</hi> 21. 1681. (having a little before been with him, to renew the Acquaintance which had been between them, while they were both in the French King's
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:152694:104"/>Service; and to perſwade him to re-ingratiate himſelf into the French and Popiſh Intereſt); and gave him, by word of Mouth, Heads to write a Pamphlet to ſcandalize the King, raiſe Rebellion, alienate the Hearts of the People, and ſet them together by the Ears. Whereupon he acquainted one Mr. <hi>Savile</hi> of <hi>Lincolns-Inn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Crown,</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> with it: And the next day Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> coming again to his Chamber in<hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> he convey'd Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> into a Cloſet, (Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> failing to come) where he both ſaw and heard the Priſoner ask him, What he had done as to the Libel; and give him further Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions about what to write, <hi>viz.</hi> That the King was Popiſhly Affected, and Arbitrarily Inclined. That King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt had an Hand in the Iriſh Rebellion, and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second did countenance the ſame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the People ſhould therefore be ſtirred up to rebel, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Day after, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again, he had convey'd Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the next Room, where he alſo might both hear and ſee, ſhewing him to Copies of what he had drawn up, which he marked that he might know them again, and ſee what alteration would be made. That <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> did them read one of the Copies, and amended it, adding ſome things, and ſtriking out other things; ſaying, The Libel was to be preſented to the French Ambaſſador's Confeſſor, and he was to preſent it to the French Ambaſſador; and that it was to beget a Difference here, while the French ſhould gain <hi>Flanders,</hi> and then they
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:152694:105"/>would make no Bones of <hi>England;</hi> and that therefore the more Treaſonable it was, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it would do the Effect. For which Libel, the Witneſs was to have 40 Guinies, and a monthly Penſion of ſome thouſand of Crowns; and that he ſhould be brought into the Cabal, where ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Proteſtants and Parliament-Men came to give an Account to the Ambaſſador how things were tranſacted: Giving him half a Sheet, written by himſelf, of further Inſtructions; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which one was, That it was in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Power to depoſe a Popiſh Poſſeſſor, as it was to oppoſe a Popiſh Succeſſor. That this Libel was to be drawn in the Name of the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> and put upon them; which the Priſoner told him they would diſperſe they knew how.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> being ſworn, gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at large, how he was convey'd by Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> into the Cloſet, and of what he ſaw and heard, as Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> had depoſed.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> alſo depoſed what he had ſeen and heard, as was before depoſed by Mr. <hi>Everard;</hi> adding, that he made a Report hereof to the Houſe of Commons, and communicated the Paper to them who immediately proceeded to the Impeachment, which was for the ſame Treaſons mentioned in this Indictment.</p>
               <p>Then the Paper was produced in Court, with <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Amendments: And the whole Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel was read over; and Mr. <hi>Bridgman,</hi> and Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> ſwore, That <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> owned his Hand-writing before the Lords in Council. [The Paſſages inſerted in the Indictment were theſe.]</p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:152694:105"/>
               <p>The Title was, <hi>The true Engliſh Man ſpeaking plain Engliſh.</hi>—In the Book was as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If <hi>James</hi> be conſcious and guilty, <hi>Charles</hi> is ſo too; believe me, both theſe are Brethren in Iniquity, they are in confederacy with <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> to introduce <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> as their Actions demonſtrate. The Parliaments <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Subject, are as heavy Yokes they'd as willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt off, for to make themſelves as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute as their Brother of <hi>France.</hi> And if this can be prayed to be their Aim and main En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, why ſhould not every true <hi>Britain</hi> be a <hi>Quaker</hi> thus far, and let the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be up, and move us all as one Man to Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence? Nay, and if need be, to open Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and fling off theſe intolerable Riders?</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in another place it is ſaid; <q>
                     <hi>J.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> both Brethren in Iniquity, corrupt both in Root and Branch, as you have ſeen they ſtudy but to enſlave you to <hi>Romiſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi>-like Yoke. Is it not plain? Have you not Eyes, Senſe, or Feeling? Where is that old <hi>Engliſh</hi> noble Spirit? Are you become <hi>French</hi> Aſſes, to ſuffer any Load to be laid upon you? And if you can get no Remedy from this next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as certainly you will not; and that the K. repents not, complies not with their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, then up all as one Man. O brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men! Look to your own Defence e'reit be too late; rouſe up your Spirits.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And in another place thus; <q>I will only add, That as it is the undoubted <hi>Right of Parliaments</hi> to make a Law againſt a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſſor, who
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:152694:106"/>would prove deſtructive to our Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties; ſo it is their undoubted Right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne any Poſſeſſor that follows Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, to the deſtruction of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In another place thus; <q>Then let all be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; then let the City of <hi>London</hi> ſtand by the Parliament with offers of any Mony, for the maintaining of their Liberties and Religion in any extream Way, if Parliamentary Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be not complied with by the King.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Priſoner in his own defence to all this, called ſeveral Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſaid, Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> told him the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel was to be printed, and to be ſent about by the Penny Poſt to the Proteſting Lords, and Leading Men of the Houſe of Commons, who were to be taken up as ſoon as they had it, and ſearched, and to have it found about them. He ſaid, the Court had a hand in it, and the King had give <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> Mony for it already, and would give him more if it had ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheriff <hi>Corniſh</hi> ſaid, when he came from <hi>Newgate</hi> to the King, to give him an Account in what diſpoſition he found the Priſoner to make a Diſcovery, the King ſaid, He had had him often before him and his Secretaries, and could make nothing of what he did diſcover; that he had for near three Months acquainted the King he was in purſuit of a Plot, relating much to his Perſon and Government; and that in as much as he made proteſtations of Zeal for his Service, he did countenance and give him ſome Mony; and that he came to him three Months before he appeared at the Council Table.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:152694:106"/>
               <p>Coll. <hi>Manſel</hi> ſaid, That Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> gave him an Account of this Buſineſs, in the preſence of Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> and others, at the Dog-Tavern, and ſaid, that when he had acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the King with it, the King ſaid, He had done him the greateſt piece of Service that ever he had done him in his Life, and gave him a great many Thanks. But he was no ſooner gone, but two Gentlemen told him, that the King ſaid, He had broken all his Meaſures, and the King would have him taken off one way or other; and ſaid, Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> ſaid, the Deſign was againſt the Proteſtant Lords, and the Proteſtant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> then confirmed the fame thing, and added, that Sir. <hi>W. Waller</hi> ſaid, The Deſign was, to contrive thoſe Papers into the Hands of the People, and make them Evidences of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheriff <hi>Bethel</hi> ſaid, That <hi>Everard,</hi> before ever he had ſeen his Face, or heard him ſpeak a word, had put in an Information of Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, at the inſtigation of his Mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; which was ſo groundleſs, that though it, was three Years before, yet he never heard a word of it till laſt Friday.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Wall,</hi> after much ſhifting, only could be ſqueez'd to ſay, that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> had 250 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> 200 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> or 150 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> for bringing in the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſcrick;</hi> adding, That he was look'd upon to be a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and upon that account it was ſaid to be dangerous to let him to near the King, that he was never admitted to him.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:152694:107"/>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> then related, how the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner was imployed to introduce him to the Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> where he met with the King; and that he interceded for the Priſoner with her.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Arran</hi> ſaid, That he and <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> dined together the Day he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and that he pulled out Papers, but he refuſed to read them: That he ever thought him of the beſt and loyalleſt Principles of any of his Religion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> ſaid, He could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the King had ever employed him.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Conway</hi> ſaid, that the King had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in Council, that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> had been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him in ſome trifling Buſineſs, and that he had got Mony of him; but added, as of his own Knowledg, that the King never ſpoke with him till after he was taken, which was <hi>Feb.</hi> 28. laſt.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bulſtrode</hi> was asked by the Priſoner, What Meſſage he brought, and what proffer he made from the Court to his Wife? But to this he would ſay nothing, only that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Wife refuſed to be examin'd, unleſs the King would ſpeak to her alone.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> would likewiſe own nothing concerning him, but that ſhe had three or four times ſpoke to the King for him to get his Eſtate in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that what Mony he had had from her, was only for Charity.</p>
               <p>After this the Priſoner concluded his Defence, complaining of his hard Uſage, profeſſing his enmity to the French Intereſt; and that <hi>Everard</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:152694:107"/>knew the Deſign of that Libel was otherwiſe; concluding, that the Jury could not find him now Guilty, becauſe of his Impeachment in a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Court.</p>
               <p>The Sol. General then ſumm'd up the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and Serj. <hi>Jefferies</hi> and the Ld. Ch. Juſtice gave the Charge to the Jury; who deſired the Opinion the Court, ſince the Priſoner had been impeached, whether they were compellable by Law to give a Verdict in this Caſe upon him? To which The Ld. Ch. Juſtice ſaid, That the Vote of the Commons, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſhould not be tried in any other Inferior Court, could not alter the Law; and that the Judges of this Court had conference with all the other Judges concerning this Matter; and it was the Opinion of all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> that this Court had a Juriſdiction to try this Man. After which Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> was of Opinion, That if the Priſoner were acquitted on this Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it might be pleaded in Bar to the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Juſtice <hi>Dolben</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Raymond</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they were of the ſame Opinion.</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew for half an hour, and then brought the Priſoner in <hi>Guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And on Wedneſday, <hi>June</hi> 15. 1681. the Ld. Ch. Juſtice ſentenc'd him to be <hi>Drawn, Hang'd,</hi> and <hi>Quartered.</hi> Which was accordingly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon him, together with <hi>Plunket,</hi> at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> on Friday, <hi>July</hi> 1. 1681.</p>

                  <hi>Hugh Duffy</hi> depoſed, That he had ſeen ſeveral of the Priſoner's Orders to raiſe Mony, and had collected ſome for him (being Curate of <hi>Cogham</hi> and a Fryer) and had, by his Order, returned him alſo a liſt of the Age of every Perſon in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:152694:109"/>his Pariſh, from 16 to 60; and that he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him, when he view'd the Port of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford,</hi> which he thought moſt convenient for landing the French; and had ſeen his Letter in <hi>France</hi> to Cardinal <hi>Bovillon,</hi> that he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with that King not to invade <hi>Spain,</hi> but rather wage War with the King of <hi>England,</hi> who had been an Apoſtate, and help their poor Country that was daily tormented with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Juriſdiction. That he was preſent at a great Conſult near <hi>Clouds,</hi> where the Priſoner was Chief; and gave ſpecial Order for a Liſt to be got of all the Officers in the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and that loſt their Eſtates, becauſe they would be more forward in this Deſign. That he himſelf was forward herein, till he had been in <hi>France</hi> in 1677, and there ſeeing the ſlavery of the French People, he thought it were better the Devil ſhould reign over them, than the <hi>French-Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edmond Murfey</hi> heſitated much in giving his Evidence, tho he had given it in the fulleſt of any to the Grand Jury, but afterwards he ran away, and was found at the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors; though he owned that the Priſoner was to get 60 or 70000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> for the eſtabliſhing Popery. But becauſe he fenced in his Evidence, the King's Counſel deſired he might be committed, which was done accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Mac-Legh,</hi> a Pariſh Prieſt in the County of <hi>Monagham</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> depoſed, That the Priſoner had received ſeveral Sums of Mony there, and he had raiſed and paid him ſome,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:152694:110"/>for Arms and Ammunition for the Papiſts: That he was at Vicar <hi>Bradey</hi>'s Houſe when Biſhop <hi>Tyrrill</hi> came thither. And that in <hi>France</hi> he had ſeen the Conditions upon which the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was made Primate, which was to raiſe Men to join with the French, to deſtroy the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Moyer,</hi> a Regular Prieſt, and Begging Frier depoſed, That in 1672, he met with a Letter of the Priſoners in <hi>Caprennica,</hi> directed to the Secretary of the Colledg, <hi>De Propaganda Fide,</hi> which he opened and copied, (producing the Copy) wherein was ſaid, That 'twas more proper for the Catholick Princes to agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to extirpate Hereſy, than to vary among themſelves; that now was the time: for there were 60000 Men ready to riſe upon ſuch an Invaſion. That in 1674, when he came into <hi>Ireland,</hi> he told the Priſoner of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that he had ſeen it, who thereupon pray'd him to be ſecret; for what he did, was not for his own Good, but for the publick Good of the Catholicks; who proffered him high Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, if he would further the Deſign. That he was at a Conſult afterwards, where the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, Biſhop <hi>Tyrrel,</hi> and others were, where they concluded to ſend Capt. <hi>Con O-Neale</hi> to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Barcellona,</hi> with certain Inſtruments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Captain ſhortly went; and the two Biſhops undertook to view <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> and that this was in 1676.</p>
               <p>To all this the Priſoner only proteſted his Innocency, complaining that his Witneſſes,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:152694:110"/>and ſome Records he had not had time to procure; and that the Jury were Strangers to him, and the Witneſſes; and that by being brought out of his Country, his Life was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, where theſe Witneſſes would not have been believed againſt him.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Sollicitor General, and Serj. <hi>Jeffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> having ſumm'd up the Evidence, and the Lord Chief Juſtice giving the Charge, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry withdrew for a quarter of an Hour, and then brought the Priſoner in <hi>Guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And on Wedneſday, <hi>June</hi> 15. after the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner had pleaded the ſame things over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and informed the Court that now his Witneſſes were come as far as <hi>Coventry;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhew'd the inſufficiency of ſuch a Plea, after ſo long time the Court had given him before his Trial, the Lord Chief Juſtice ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd him to be <hi>Drawn, Hang'd,</hi> and <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which accordingly was execcuted upon him (together with <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>) at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, <hi>July</hi> 1. following.</p>

               <p>To whom the Indictment being read, and then opened by Sir <hi>Thomas Stringer</hi> (of Counſel for the King in this Cauſe) the King's Witneſſes were,</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>John Smith,</hi> who being ſworn, told what he knew of the Plot in general (much like what he related at the Trial of my Ld. <hi>Stafford,</hi> to which the Reader is referred:) As to what he knew of the Plot in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> was, that while he lived with Mr. <hi>Jenniſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thwing</hi> the Prieſt, who had ſuffered as a Conſpirator, much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to intreat Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> to ſend his Daughters to <hi>Dolebank,</hi> where a Nunnery was
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:152694:111"/>to be erected; and he knew ſeveral that were there. That he told him Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry zealous for promoting Popery, and had contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted largely to it; and was engaged with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others for making a Founder for <hi>Dolebank.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Robert Bolron</hi> depoſed his Knowledg of the Plot, juſt as he had done before at <hi>Thwing</hi>'s Trial, charging the Priſoner to have been at that Conſult at <hi>Barnborow-hall</hi> in 1677, and thereat promiſed to give 200 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> towards the killing of the King; It being then reſolved to be done, and <hi>Pickering</hi> mentioned to do it; and it was ſaid, that if the D. of <hi>York</hi> did not pleaſe, they would ſerve him as they would ſerve his Brother.—That one <hi>Sherborn</hi> told him that Sir <hi>Miles</hi> was to be a Privy-Councellour, and that they would procure the Dukes conſent to it. —That he was alſo at a Conſult at <hi>Barnborow, June</hi> the 13th, 1678. and there it was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taking of <hi>Hull,</hi> the letting in of the <hi>French</hi> there; diſcourſing that the Ld. <hi>Bellaſis</hi> had cauſed the Block-Houſes to be almoſt ruin'd, that the <hi>French</hi> might more eaſily come in, and they had all Pardons for their Sins; and that he had ſeen a colluſive Conveyance of the Priſoner's Eſtate.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Lawrence Mowbray</hi> depoſed, that Sir <hi>Miles</hi> was at the Conſult in 1676 at <hi>Ruſhton</hi>'s Chamber, where <hi>Ruſhton</hi> gave him the Oath of Secrecy, and he promiſed to be true to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and would venture his Life and Eſtate for the promoting of ſo good a Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Bayns</hi> was ſworn; who only depos'd that he had ſeen Sir <hi>Miles</hi> at ſeveral meetings at <hi>Barnborough-hall,</hi> but knew nothing of what was diſcourſed thereat.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:152694:112"/>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton</hi> began his Defence proteſting his Innocency, and having croſs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd only <hi>Bolron,</hi> he called Mr. <hi>Lowther</hi> to prove he did not accuſe him, when he was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by him; Yea, Mr. <hi>Lowther</hi> ſaid, he told him that he knew nothing againſt Sir <hi>Miles,</hi> but believed he was clear. But afterwards he told him that <hi>Mowbray</hi> could accuſe him, and of what; which <hi>Bolron</hi> denied both.</p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>Thomas Yarbrough</hi> teſtified that <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> told him alſo, <hi>Aug.</hi> 10, 1679. that he knew nothing of Sir <hi>Miles</hi>'s being concern'd in the Plot, but believed him to be a very honeſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; only he knew he had made a colluſive Conveyance of his Eſtate, as moſt Papiſts he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved had done, for Security.—<hi>Bolron</hi> denied this, and depoſed that he accuſed Sir <hi>Miles</hi> to the Council, not in his firſt, but ſecond Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which was after the 10th of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lady <hi>Yarbrough</hi> then gave in the ſame Teſtimony with her Husband.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Normanton</hi> teſtified that in <hi>June</hi> 1679. <hi>Bolron</hi> told him that Sir <hi>Tho. Gaſcoyne</hi> would give 1000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> for killing the King, and the Lady <hi>Tempeſt</hi> would have hang'd him for breaking a Trunk, but now he would be even with her: and that Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton</hi> kept Prieſts in his Houſe, but he would apprehend them preſently, for he might have 20 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> apiece for taking of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard Pears,</hi> Sir <hi>Miles</hi>'s Man, teſtified, that three or four days after his Maſter was taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Cuſtody, <hi>Bolron</hi> asked him if they did not blame him for accuſing his Maſter? and he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:152694:112"/>he did not hear him named; ſaid he, it was not him, but I muſt not tell who it is; and ſaid he would have gone to have ſeen Sir <hi>Miles,</hi> but I think (ſaid he) he does not know me.</p>
               <p>Then one <hi>Stephen Tompſon</hi> declared ſome threatning Words of <hi>Bolrons</hi> againſt Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoyne,</hi> that he would do him ſome ill turn; but it not concerning the Priſoner, the Court would not admit it.</p>
               <p>The Lady <hi>Vavaſor</hi> ſaid, ſhe believed her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was not at <hi>Barnborow</hi> in any part of the Year, becauſe he was infirm at <hi>York</hi> (<hi>Bolron</hi> having ſworn that Sir <hi>VValter Vavaſor</hi> was one at that Conſult) but this was not judg'd a concluſive Evidence.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Leggat</hi> ſaid that he had heard <hi>Bolron</hi> ſay, he knew nothing againſt Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Holmes</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Bolron</hi> meeting her in <hi>London,</hi> ſaid he heard ſhe was to be a Witneſs againſt him at <hi>York,</hi> but if ſhe would be kind to him, he would be ſo to her, and ſpeak as favourably as he could; and he ſaid, if he had known he ſhould have been no better rewarded, he would never have been a Witneſs; the Devil ſhould have been a Witneſs as ſoon as he.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Edward Cooper</hi> told what he heard <hi>Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi> ſay, (as before in <hi>Thwing</hi>'s Trial) but the Court obſerved that being before his Diſcovery, and while he was a Papiſt, and on the High-way, it could not be material.</p>
               <p>Then Madam <hi>Sherborn</hi> teſtified that <hi>Bolron</hi> and <hi>Mowbray</hi> came to her houſe, under a pretence to ſearch for Prieſts, and <hi>Bolron</hi> took away ſeveral
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:152694:113"/>parcels of Silver with him.—But the Court would not ſuffer ſuch Evidence; beſides that <hi>Mowbray</hi> depoſed it was only Chalices and other Popiſh Trinkets.</p>
               <p>After this the Counſel for the King called one <hi>Dixon,</hi> who ſwore that he had 40 <abbr>s.</abbr> prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him to be a Witneſs for Sir <hi>Tho. Gaſcoyne</hi> in <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1679.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>VVilſon</hi> depoſed that Mr. <hi>Babbing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Sollicitor for Sir <hi>Miles,</hi> would have given him 10 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and <hi>Hickeringil</hi> proffer'd him 10 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> to have been a Witneſs for Sir <hi>Miles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Chriſtopher Langley</hi> depoſed alſo that <hi>VVil. Batley</hi> and <hi>John Roſs</hi> proffer'd him two Oxen and ten Sheep to witneſs for Sir <hi>Miles</hi> thoſe things they ſhould direct him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard Corker</hi> depoſed, that he was by, and heard that very proffer made to <hi>Langley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Baines</hi> depoſed, that Mrs. <hi>Holmes</hi> proffer'd him 60 <hi>
                     <abbr>l.</abbr> per annum,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Hewit</hi> ſaid ſhe would give him more, if he would ſay nothing againſt Sir <hi>Miles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this Mr. Juſtice <hi>Dolben</hi> ſumm'd up the Evidence, and Baron <hi>Gregory</hi> proceeded to do the ſame, and then the Jury withdrew for half an hour, and gave in their Verdict, <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>

               <p>To whom the Indictment being read, Mr. <hi>Bridges,</hi> of Counſel for the King in this Cauſe, opened the ſame; and Mr. <hi>Coombes,</hi> another of the King's Counſel, opened the Evidence. And then Mr. <hi>Gilbert,</hi> a Juſtice of Peace for the County of <hi>Derby</hi> was called, and Sworn, who depoſed that he lived within 2 Miles of Mr. <hi>Powtrells</hi> houſe at <hi>Weſt-Hallam,</hi> where <hi>Busby</hi> was took, and whoſe Wife was <hi>Busby's</hi> Neece, and had heard for 6 or 7 Years that he was a Prieſt, and when the Plot broke out, that he was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concern'd, as appeared by a Warrant from the Lords of the Council, for his Apprehenſion, which he received <hi>March</hi> 22, 1678. (which he producing, was read in the Court) and on the Monday following ſearched Mr. <hi>Powtrells</hi> Houſe for him, but could not find him, tho afterwards he was informed that he was then in the Houſe. In (1679) Mr. <hi>Powtrel</hi> travelling, it was reported <hi>Busby</hi> was gone with him beyond Sea, tho he ſtill remained in that Houſe; and laſt Chriſtmas he was informed, that he was ſeen in Corn-Harveſt, walking in the Garden with one <hi>Anne Smally</hi> a Widow; which caus'd him to ſearch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for him in <hi>March</hi> laſt, when this <hi>Smally</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him, he had been out of <hi>England</hi> two Years;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:152694:114"/>yet he then found in <hi>Busby</hi>'s Chamber Popiſh Veſtments, a Surplice, Wafers, an Altar-ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but could not find him. About a fortnight after he ſearched again for him, ſurprizing them at one in the Night, but could have no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance till they broke open the door; and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Busby</hi>'s Chamber, he found the fire had been lately extinguiſhed, and the Bed-Clothes laid in confuſed heaps on the bed, ſome part of them warm, and ſome cold; but the feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed quite cold, till feeling underneath, he found it warm, and that it had been turned; which aſſured him, that the Prieſt was in the Houſe; but the Perſons in the houſe denied it, and only jeered them, for ſearching for a Perſon that was beyond Sea; and thoſe that were without tho they heard a trampling, and directed the Searchers within to the place; yet they were from one till after 10 next Morning before they could find him; Which at laſt they did in a little hole under the Tiling, whence they carried him to <hi>Derby;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gilbert</hi> having took his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, committed him to Goal on <hi>March</hi> 16th, and ſent Word to the King and Council of what he had done. The Priſoner then plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his being an Alien, born at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther removing his Family thither, during the Troubles, but the Act for Naturalization was read to him, and he thereby judg'd a Natural-born Subject.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Joſeph Dudley</hi> depoſed, that he was a Servant to Mr. <hi>Powtrel,</hi> and had known the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner above ſix Years, and had heard him ſay Maſs, Preach, Pray, Catechiſe and Chriſten;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:152694:115"/>and ſeen him in his Robes, and that he uſed to keep faſt the Doors, tho a Proteſtant; and that he had owned himſelf a Jeſuit to him, and that Mr. <hi>Evers,</hi> the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Prieſt, was his Tutor. —And that he had heard him tell how his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe was Plundred at <hi>Coddington</hi> in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> and how he hid himſelf in the Curtains being two Years old; and in the Garden-Hedge, when he was five Years old, for fear of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; and that ſoon after his Mother went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, where ſhe had ſeveral Children. —That he endeavour'd to ſubvert the Witneſs, who ſeemingly did comply, and was therefore entruſted.</p>
               <p>Then to prove him further a Prieſt, Mr. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> produced his Account-Book which he had took; which teſtify'd him to have been Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator for the Jeſuits, and to have received Rents of their Lands, from (73) till (77) and to have disburſed great ſums of Mony, and to have had dealings with <hi>Gawen, Harcourt, Turner, Ireland, Pool, Bennet, Heaton, Thomſon,</hi> and others of the Society; and produced his Popiſh Garments, and Trinkets; which one Mr. <hi>Sheppey,</hi> a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that had formerly been a Popiſh Prieſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the names and uſe of to the Court.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Thomas Houis</hi> depoſed, that this <hi>Busby</hi> perſuaded him to be a Papiſt, being about to marry a Papiſt's Daughter, whom otherwiſe he could not have; and that he gave him Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and married him; and that he had heard him ſay Maſs ſeveral times in his Robes, and preach thrice; and had received the Sacrament from him, and had a Child baptized by him;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:152694:115"/>naming where, and who were Sureties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elizabeth Evans</hi> depoſed, that ſhe had ſeen him ſay Maſs in his Prieſtly Habit; and been Confeſs'd by him, and receiv'd the Sacrament from him, and was Godmother to a Child bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dorothy Sanders</hi> depoſed the ſame; and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how he uſed to elevate the Hoſt; only ſhe never ſaw him baptize.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sarah Clark</hi> depoſed to the ſame purpoſe; ſhe being the Perſon that carried <hi>Houis</hi>'s child to be baptized by him.—There were three or four more Wineſſes ready to have depoſed the like; but the Evidence being ſo full, the Court waved them.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner in his own Defence, urged, that the Witneſſes ſwore to what they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; their Service being in Latin; and as for the Veſtments they were only kept as Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that Lay-Men might wear them, as well as Prieſts; which was atteſted by <hi>Robert Needham,</hi> whom the Priſoner called.—And Mr. <hi>Charles <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mphrevil</hi> teſtified that he had heard Mr. <hi>Busby</hi>'s Mother and Brother ſay, that he was born at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and that he had an <hi>Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit</hi> from the Regiſter at <hi>Coddington</hi> of all their Children born in <hi>England,</hi> and the Priſoners name is not in the Regiſter.

               <p>Then the firſt Witneſs produced againſt him was, Mr. <hi>Stephen Dugdale,</hi> who depoſed, That he having been acquainted with Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Years, had oft heard him rail againſt the King, ſaying, That he was a Papiſt, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not proſecute the Papiſts as he
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:152694:117"/>thought, ſufficiently) and that he was as deep in the Plot as any Papiſt of them all; and that he had a hand in Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfry</hi>'s Death. That there was nothing to be expected from the King, but introducing of Popery and Arbitrary Government: That there was no Truſt to be put in him, but it was the People we muſt truſt to: And we muſt look to arm our ſelves, and that he would Arm himſelf and be here at <hi>Oxford,</hi> having ſeveral ſtout Men (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Capt. <hi>Chinton,</hi> Capt. <hi>Browne,</hi> and one <hi>Don Lewis</hi>) that would ſtand by him, in caſe there ſhould be a Riſing, which he expected, at <hi>Oxford,</hi> if the King and Parliament did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. <hi>Colledge</hi> giving Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> before his coming to <hi>Oxford,</hi> as much Ribbon as came to forty Shillings, with, <hi>No Popery, No Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> wrought in it, to diſtribute among his Friends in the Country, that they might be known by other Perſons that would wear the ſame. And that at <hi>London,</hi> being once in a Coffee-Houſe with Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> and with ſome of the Members of the Houſe of Commons, a little before they met, talking of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and of ſome Diſturbance that was likely to happen there; it was then fully agreed, that it would be the beſt way, out of every County, where the Parliament had the beſt Intereſt in the People, to leave one in every County that might manage the People. And that at <hi>Oxford,</hi> when Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> perceived that the King would not yield to the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, he ſaid, Let him begin as ſoon as he would, he did not care how ſoon, for their
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:152694:118"/>Party was but an Handful to him and his Party, (meaning the Diſſenters) calling them the <hi>True Proteſtants,</hi> and the Church of <hi>England</hi> only <hi>Proteſtants in Maſquerade.</hi> And that Day the King went out of Town, preſently after he went, Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> ſaid to him, in the Barber's Shop that is juſt within the <hi>Angel-Inn,</hi> that <hi>Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> (meaning the King) was gone, the Rogue was afraid of himſelf, he was ſhirk'd away.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> produced ſome Papers whereof he affirmed that Mr. <hi>Colledg</hi> had owned himſelf to be Author; as the <hi>Letter</hi> pretended to be <hi>intercepted to Roger Le Strange;</hi> the <hi>Rary-ſhow,</hi> and <hi>Character of a Popiſh Succeſſor;</hi> which were read and explained in the Court.</p>
               <p>And then one <hi>Stevens</hi> (being ſworn) depoſed, %%that he found the firſt draught of the <hi>Rary-ſhow</hi> in Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Bed-chamber, when he came to ſearch his Papers, by Order of Council; and that the Printer that printed the Ballad, had told him ſince, he had it from him, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Atterbury</hi> and <hi>Sawel</hi> affirmed; but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per being look'd for in the Court, could not be found.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>John Smith</hi> was ſworn, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he was intimately acquainted with Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> and that going to dine with him at Alderman <hi>Wilcox</hi>'s, he being a Stranger, ask'd what the Alderman was, and <hi>Colledge</hi> told him, he was a Man as true as Steel, and a Man that would endeavour to root out Popery; to which he reply'd that that might be done eaſily, if he could but prevail with the King to paſs the Bill againſt the D. of <hi>York;</hi> he anſwered No, No,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:152694:118"/>he was miſtaken; for <hi>Rowley</hi> (meaning the King) was as great a Papiſt as the D. of <hi>York,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way as dangerous to the Proteſtant Intereſt, as was too apparent by his Arbitrary ruling. And afterwards in the Tavern where they dined, he asking him the ſecond time (before the Alderman came) what kind of Man he was; he ſaid he was one that lived in his Country-houſe, and gave freely to ſeveral People to buy Arms and Ammunition, to bring the King to Submiſſion to his People; adding, that he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred old <hi>Rowley</hi> did not conſider how eaſily his Father's Head came to the Block, which he doubted not would be the end of <hi>Rowley</hi> at the laſt. And after dinner, all departing, <hi>Colledge</hi> told him, if he would go with him to his own houſe, he ſhould ſee how he was prepared with Arms and Proviſion. And ſoon after dining with him, he ſhewed him his Piſtols, his Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbuſs, his great Sword, his Armour, Back and Breaſt, and his Head-piece, which was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered (as he remembred) with Chamlet, and was a fine thing; <hi>Colledge</hi> telling him that theſe were the things which would deſtroy the pitiful Guards of <hi>Rowley,</hi> that were kept up contrary to Law and Juſtice, to ſet up Arbitrary Power and Popery. And a little before the <hi>Oxford</hi>-Parliament met, he meeting <hi>Colledge</hi> again, and diſcourſing ſeveral things, <hi>Colledge</hi> told him what Preparations the City were making, how they were provided with Powder and Bullets; and that he would go down to <hi>Oxford</hi> expecting a little ſport there, upon the Diviſions that were like to be between the King and Parliament;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:152694:119"/>and that he would be one that would ſeize the King, if he ſhould ſeize any of the Members, as he expected he would. And again, meeting the Priſoner after his return from <hi>Oxford,</hi> he told him that he went thither in expectation of ſome ſport, but old <hi>Rowley</hi> was afraid, like his Grand-father <hi>Jamy,</hi> and ſo ran away like to beſhit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And that <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> and he had had a quarrel at the Parliament door of the Houſe of Lords at <hi>Oxford,</hi> that <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> had call'd him Rogue, and made his Noſe Bleed; but before long that he hoped to ſee a great deal more Blood ſhed for the Cauſe. And after this, when there was a Diſcourſe of diſarming the City, and that the Ld. <hi>Feverſham</hi> was to come to do it, he ſaid, That he was well provided, and that if <hi>Feverſham,</hi> or any Man, nay <hi>Rowley</hi> himſelf, ſhould attempt any ſuch thing, he would be the Death of him, before any Man ſhould ſeize upon his Arms; deſiring him to get Arms for himſelf too: becauſe he did not know how he might make uſe of them; accordingly he had an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour from him upon Trial, which he ſaid coſt him 30 or 40 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> but it proving too big, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned it, and bought him a new one.</p>
               <p>Next to him <hi>Bryan Haynes</hi> was ſworn, who depoſed likewiſe that he had been acquainted with Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> ever ſince <hi>March</hi> laſt, before the ſitting of the Parliament at <hi>Oxford:</hi> For there being a Warrant againſt him for High Treaſon, he made his Application to <hi>Colledg,</hi> and deſired him to go to a certain Perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in <hi>England,</hi> and ask his advice, Whether he might not ſuperſede the Warrant by putting
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:152694:119"/>in Bayl, and carry the <hi>Superſedeas</hi> in his Pocket: Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> told him he would go to this Perſon of Honour, for he would do nothing of his own head, and he bid him come to him the next day; which accordingly he did, and asked him what was the reſult, and what advice he had from that Perſon of Quality? he bid him be of good chear, that the Parliament would be, and ſit at <hi>Oxford</hi> ſoon, and that he ſhould not value the King a pin, for that the King was in a worſe Condition than either of them; and he ſhould ſee that he ſhould be call'd to an Account for all his Actions; for all the World might ſee that he did reſolve to bring in Arbitrary Power and Popery; and that unleſs he would let the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſit at <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſince he had called them together, and put the People to Charges in chuſing them, and them in coming down, he ſhould be ſeiz'd at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and brought to the Block, as was the Logger-head his Father. That the Parliament ſhould ſit at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and adjuſt the Grievances of the Subject, and of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that no King of his Race ſhould ever Reign in <hi>England</hi> after him. And unleſs the King did expel from his Council the Earl of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon,</hi> cunning <hi>Lory Hide,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> (that great turn-coat Rogue, that was before ſo much againſt the Papiſts; a Raſcal, whom we ſhould ſee hang'd, and all the <hi>Tory</hi> Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors) <hi>England</hi> ſhould be too hot for him. That for this End there was in the City 1500 Barrels of Powder, and 100000 Men ready at an hour's warning; and that every thing was ordered in a due Method againſt the ſitting of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:152694:120"/>at <hi>Oxford.</hi> And that he ſhould ſee <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the moſt glorious Nation in the World, when they had cut off that beaſtly Fellow <hi>Rowley,</hi> who came of the Race of Buggerers; for his Grand-father King <hi>James</hi> buggered the old Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> Railing then at Judg <hi>Pemberton,</hi> ſaying, Let him try <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> if he dare; I ſhall ſee him go to <hi>Tyburn</hi> for it, I hope, a turn-coat Rogue. That he was for the Plot whilſt he was <hi>puiſne</hi> Judg, but now he was Chief Juſtice, he was the greateſt Rogue in the World; even like one of the Penſioners in the Long Parliament. That the Priſoner would moreover have put this Informant upon charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King With the firing of <hi>London,</hi> and the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfry;</hi> telling him, that ſuch and ſuck Lords ſhould live and die by him, and that he needed not to fear, but that <hi>England</hi> ſhould eſpouſe his Cauſe. And diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing then of the Libel of <hi>Fitz-Harris;</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil take me, ſaid <hi>Colledge,</hi> every individual Word is as true as God is in Heaven; and that if the Informant did not join with <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> in his Evidence, and charge the King home, he was the baſeſt Fellow in the World, becauſe he made them Slaves and Beggars, and would make all the World ſo; and that it was a kind of Charity to charge him home, that we might be rid of ſuch a Tyrant.</p>
               <p>He depos'd further, That he alſo receiv'd a blew Ribbond from Mr. <hi>Colledge;</hi> whom meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after he came from <hi>Oxford,</hi> he asked, Where now were all his Cracks and Braggs, for that the King had fool'd them? who anſwered, That
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:152694:120"/>they had not done with the King yet, though they could do nothing then; for that no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, no Man living did know whether he would diſſolve the Parliament that Day: That he was that very nick of Time at the <hi>Lobby</hi> of the Lords Houſe; and there was a Man came in with a Gown under his Arm, and every one looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to be a Tailor; and no Body did ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, no not his own intimate Friends, except it were <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> that he would Diſſolve the Parliament that Day. But preſently he put on his Robes, and ſent away for the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and when he had diſſolved them, before ever the Houſe could get down, he took Coach and went away, otherwiſe that the Parliament had been too hard for him; for that there was never a Parliament-Man, but had divers armed Men to wait on him; and that he had his Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbuſs and his Man to wait upon him.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs againſt Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> was Mr. <hi>Turbervile,</hi> who (being ſworn) depoſed, That when the Parliament ſat in <hi>Oxford,</hi> about the middle of the Week, he dined with Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> Capt. <hi>Brown,</hi> and <hi>Don Lewis</hi> Clerk of <hi>Derby-Houſe,</hi> at the <hi>Chequer-Inn</hi> in <hi>Oxford.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner <hi>Don Lewis</hi> went out about ſome Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and Capt. <hi>Brown</hi> went to ſleep; and Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> and he fell a talking of the Times; and he was obſerving, he thought the Parliament was not a long-liv'd Parliament: Whereupon Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> anſwered, That there was no Good to be expected from the King, for he and all his Family were Papiſts, and had ever been ſuch. Then ſaid <hi>Turbervile,</hi> the King will offer ſomething
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:152694:121"/>or other by way of ſurprize to the Parliament. Said <hi>Colledge,</hi> I would he would begin; but if he do not, we will begin with him and ſeize him, for there are ſeveral brave Fellows about this Town that will ſecure him, till we have thoſe Terms that we expect from him; adding, That he had got a Caſe of Piſtols, and a very good Sword, and a Velvet Cap: Giving <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervile</hi> a piece of blew Ribbond to put in his Hat, to be a diſtinction if there ſhould be any diſturbance.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> was ſworn, who depoſed, That he and <hi>Colledge</hi> had been long acquainted: And that a little before the Parliament at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> about <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> after the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Charlton</hi>'s Shop, the Wollen-Draper in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-Yard, diſcourſing with him about the Government, he was juſtifying of the late Long-Parliament's Actions, in Forty: He ſaid, That that Parliament was as good a Parliament as ever was choſen in the Nation; and that they did nothing but what they had juſt cauſe for; and that the Parliament that ſat laſt at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was of their Opinion, and ſo he ſhould have ſeen it. And that another time, he calling him, in a jocoſe way, <hi>Colonel; Colledge</hi> bid him mock not, for he might be one in a little time.</p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>William Jennings</hi> being ſworn, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, That <hi>Colledge</hi> gave him one time a Picture; and another time he ſaw him bring into a Coffee-Houſe a parcel of blew Ribbond, with, <hi>No Popery, No Slavery</hi> wrought in it; and ſold a Yard of it there to a Parliament-Man (as he
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:152694:121"/>took him to be) for 2 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> who tied it upon his Sword. And that on that very Day the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was Diſſolved at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he came to him, ſtanding in the School-Houſe-yard, telling him, Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> had ſpit in his Face, and that he ſpit in his Face again, and that ſo they went to Logerheads together; and that upon Sir <hi>William</hi>'s telling him his Noſe bled, he ſaid, I have loſt the firſt blood in the Cauſe, but it will not be long before more be loſt.</p>
               <p>The Evidence for the King here ending, Mr. Serj. <hi>Holloway,</hi> briefly explained to the Jury, that the ſeizing the Perſon of the King, was, in Law, a compaſſing and intending his Death, as it was worded in the Indictment; which therefore they ought ſo to underſtand.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> deſired to be reſolved theſe Queſtions upon the Evidence which he had heard. 1. Whether any <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> (for which his Indictment was) had been herein proved? 2. Whether there ought not to be two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes diſtinct, to ſwear words at one and the ſame time? And, 3. Whether any Act of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon done at <hi>London,</hi> ſhall be given in Evidence to prove the Treaſon for which he was now In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, and which was given in Evidence before the Grand-Jury, upon the Trial was there grounded?</p>
               <p>To the firſt, the Ed. Ch. Juſtice reply'd, That a <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> was prov'd (if the Witneſſes ſpeak Truth) by his publiſhing Libels and Pictures to make the King odious and contemptible in the Eyes of the People, and his being the Author of ſome of them, and they being found in his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:152694:122"/>To the Second it was anſwered, That the Reſolution of the Judges in my Lord <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s Caſe, is contrary; There being two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to an Indictment of Treaſon, tho there be but one Witneſs that proves one Fact, which is an Evidence of Treaſon, and another that proves another, that is an Evidence of the ſame Treaſon, tho they be but ſingle Witneſſes to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Facts. And to the Third it was anſwer'd in the Affirmative, it being any Act of Treaſon that is of the ſame kind.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> being call'd upon to call his Witneſſes, he expreſs'd himſelf in a long Speech, proteſting his own Innocency, not doubting to prove this one of the Helliſheſt Conſpiracies that ever was upon the face of the Earth, and theſe the moſt notorious wicked Men; an abſolute Deſign to deſtroy all the Proteſtants of <hi>England</hi> who have had the Courage to oppoſe the Popiſh Plot; in which no Man of his condition had done more than he had done. Declaring, that he was bred a Proteſtant, and continued ſo hitherto, and by the Grace of God would die ſo. That he had been concern'd with Perſons of Honour, and could not be reaſonably deem'd ſuch a Fool or Madman as to talk of ſuch things to Papiſts, Prieſts and Iriſh-Men, who had broke their Faith with their own Party, and upon whom he could lay no ſuch Oaths and Obligations. That his acquaintance with <hi>Haynes</hi> began upon a Diſcovery he made to him, how <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> had employed him to ſetch over <hi>Macnamarra</hi> to ſwear againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> High-Treaſon, as he had done, <hi>viz.</hi> That my Lord
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:152694:122"/>ſhould tell <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> that he had a Deſign to bring this Kingdom to a Common-Wealth, and to root out the Family of the <hi>Stuarts;</hi> which he ſwore was true, and a great deal more, which he knew, and would diſcover, about ſeizing and deſtroying the Parliament at <hi>Oxford;</hi> about an Army in the North that was to be raiſed about the time of the ſitting of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at <hi>Oxford;</hi> Of a French Army that was to land in <hi>Ireland</hi> at the ſame time, that the D. of <hi>York</hi> was to be at the head of them; and the intention was, to deſtroy all the Proteſtants. Upon this it was that he reſolved to come along with the Parliament, and if there was any ſuch Deſign, to live and die with them. That he was imployed by ſeveral Lords and Parliament-Men, when the Parliament ſat laſt at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to ſearch under the Parliament Houſe, whence he got the Name of the <hi>Proteſtant Joyner.</hi> And that this <hi>Haynes</hi> did ſwear in his Affidavit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sir <hi>George Treby</hi> the Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> That there was a Deſign to deſtroy the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and there was not only his Oath for it, but it was the general belief, that ſome Evil was intended them: But as for the ſeizing of the King, that he never heard one word of it before he came hither; that he knew not of one Man upon the Face of the Earth that was to ſtand by him; and how impoſſible it was for him alone to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, all Men might judge: That he hoped to prove theſe Witneſſes ſuborned; complaining of his cloſe Impriſonment.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:152694:123"/>
               <p>Then the Firſt Witneſs that appear'd for the Priſoner, was <hi>William Shewin,</hi> who declared, That he was in <hi>Turbervil</hi>'s company on Thurſday Night laſt, at the Golden Poſts at <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> and there he heard him ſay, That if he were at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he ſhould hear ſtrange things againſt <hi>Colledge,</hi> and he would lay ten to one that Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wilmore</hi> ſhould be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and he would lead him by the Gold Chain along <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> and down with his Breeches in the middle of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Coffee-Houſe, with a Band about his Neck, and a Cloak. And that one told him, there was one that did deſign to be return'd upon this Jury, that was reſolv'd to hang <hi>Colledge</hi> right or wrong. Which the High Sheriff acknowledg'd alſo, and that he had therefore left him out, for which the Court gave him his due Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Henry Hickman</hi> (who had been called before) a Cabinet-maker at <hi>Holborn-Bridge,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, who declared, That he knew <hi>Haynes</hi> very well, he oft coming to his Houſe to a Widow who lodged there, a Papiſt: and that therefore he took him for a Prieſt. And that diſcourſing with his Tenant concerning him, ſhe told him that he was a dangerous Fellow, though a Papiſt, and that he cared not much what he ſweared againſt any one. And that he over-heard him diſcourſing with his Tenant in her Chamber, and ſaying, <hi>God dam-me, I care not what I ſwear, nor who I ſwear againſt; for 'tis my trade to get mony by ſwearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:152694:123"/>
               <p>Then <hi>Elizabeth Oliver</hi> was called, who only produced a Letter which ſhe affirmed <hi>Haynes</hi> to have writ in her Father's Name, and that he was an ill Man; which being judg'd by the Court nothing to the purpoſe, ſhe was diſmiſs'd. And,</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Hall</hi> was next call'd, who declared, That <hi>Haynes</hi> lodged at her Houſe, and that he told her (enquiring of him about <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>'s Trial) that Madam <hi>Portſmouth</hi> begg'd of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> upon her Knees, that he would try to get Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> and ſome others over to make a Presbyterian Plot of it. Another time, that ſhe heard him ſpeak of a Meſſage he had had from the King to come in, and he ſhould have his Pardon. And that he read once to her an Advertiſement, in anſwer to ſomething <hi>Thompſon</hi> had written againſt him in his Intelligence, which he ſaid he had writ, and was then going to get it put into one of the Intelligences, it being to this purpoſe; <q>That whereas one <hi>Nathaniel Thompſon</hi> had falſly and maliciouſly accuſed one <hi>Bryan Haynes</hi> for ſpeaking, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Words; he, the ſaid <hi>Bryan Haynes</hi> doth declare, that he challenges any Man to charge him with it; but he owned he had an hand, or was employed to put the Plot upon the Diſſenting-Proteſtants.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Mary Richards,</hi> Mrs <hi>Hall</hi>'s Maid, was called, who owned the ſame things affirmed by her Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Next, Mrs <hi>Wingfield,</hi> whoſe Daughter <hi>Haynes</hi> married, was call'd, who would ſay nothing of <hi>Haynes</hi> but what was for his Credit.</p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:152694:124"/>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>John Whaley</hi> was call'd, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That about 6 Years Ago, when <hi>Haynes</hi> was a Priſoner in the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> he came down to drink in the Cellar, which he had taken of the Marſhal, and ſtole a Tankard, for which the Marſhal removed him from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Side, and put him into the Common Side; which was all he knew of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> called next for Mr. <hi>John Lun,</hi> who declared, how that about three or four days after the Bill was brought <hi>Ignoramns</hi> by the Grand Jury upon Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> he was drinking with <hi>Haynes,</hi> who fell very foul againſt the Grand Jury, becauſe they had not found that Bill; and he ſaid, my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was a little Toad, but that he would do his Buſineſs very ſuddenly. Then he railed upon the Parliament, and ſaid, they were a Company of Rogues, they would give the King no Mony, but that he would help him to Mony enough out of the Phanaticks Eſtates. And ſaid, that they would damn their Souls to the Devil before the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Cauſe ſhould ſink. And that on Munday laſt, meeting with <hi>Haynes</hi> again at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge</hi> at the <hi>Crown,</hi> in diſcourſe he heard him ſay, that Sheriff <hi>Bethel</hi>'s Eſtate ſhould be the King's e're long.—To invalidate this Teſtimony, <hi>Haynes</hi> deny'd that ever he ſaw <hi>Lun</hi> before he ſaw him at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge;</hi> which was ſworn alſo by Mr. <hi>White,</hi> the King's Meſſenger, who was by, and whoſe Priſoner Mr. <hi>Lun</hi> had been two Years; affirming, that <hi>Lun</hi> ask'd him who <hi>Haynes</hi> was, and that he heard no ſuch words ſpoken: after which Serj. <hi>Jefferies</hi> beſpatter'd him with ſome of his Reflections.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:152694:124"/>
               <p>Next Mr. <hi>Jeremiah Broadgate</hi> was call'd, who ſaid, That drinking with Mr. <hi>Turbervile,</hi> he told him how the King's Evidence were villified, and looked upon as poor inconſiderable Fellows, and that he had had very great Offers from the Court if he would diſown the Popiſh Plot, and go upon the contrary Side.—Which Evidence alſo was rejected as nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>John Zeal</hi> was called, who becauſe he could ſay nothing but what he had heard Mr. <hi>Ivy</hi> tell him, was ſet aſide; And</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Ivy</hi> was called, who confeſſing, that he had given Evidence againſt the Priſoner, the Priſoner concluded he could be no good one for him. Therefore</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>William Lewes</hi> was called, who declared he knew nothing of any of the Evidence as to the Priſoner; that he could only ſay ſomething of Mr. <hi>Ivy,</hi> as to a Presbyterian Plot, and my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> And therefore,</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was next called, who produced a Petition to the Common-Council, ſubſcribed by <hi>Edward Turbervile, John Macnamarra,</hi> &amp;c. wherein they ſet out how they had been tempted to unſay what they had ſaid againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. And declared, he charging <hi>Turbervile</hi> as if he was to be a Witneſs at the <hi>Old Baily</hi> againſt <hi>Colledge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Turbervile</hi> ſaid, He would break any ones head that ſhould ſay ſo againſt him; for he neither was a Witneſs, nor could give any Evidence againſt him. Of which tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, (after he had been at <hi>Oxford</hi>) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he had been ſworn againſt <hi>Colledge</hi> before the Grand Jury: For, ſaid he, the Proteſtant-Citizens,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:152694:125"/>have deſerted us; and, <hi>God damn him,</hi> he would not ſtarve.—This <hi>Turbervile</hi> then flatly denied upon his Oath, and the Doctor affirmed upon the Word of a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> the Doctor affirmed, That upon ſome provoking words between him and Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> at <hi>Richard</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe, he heard him ſwear, <hi>God Damn him he would have</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<hi>'s Blood.</hi> For which Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> reproving him, as unbecoming words for a Miniſter of the Goſpel, his reply was, <hi>God damn the Goſpel.</hi>— This <hi>Smith</hi> alſo denied.</p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> the Doctor ſaid that he had declared to him, (upon the report of his being an Evidence againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and ſeveral Proteſtants) that he knew nothing againſt any Proteſtant in <hi>England.</hi> Afterwards the Doctor telling him, he fear'd he had gone againſt his Conſcience, he was ſure againſt what he had declared to him: Said he, It was all long of Col. <hi>Warcup,</hi> for I could get no Mony elſe; and ſaid, that the Colonel did promiſe he ſhould have a place at the Cuſtom-houſe. This <hi>Dugdale</hi> deny'd.—So the Court took notice to the Jury of theſe three Mens Oaths againſt the Doctor's bare Word: Which Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> complain'd of as not fair dealing. And that if he could wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for himſelf, he could diſcover more than this that <hi>Dugdale</hi> had ſaid to him alone; how that he was forced to keep Company with <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cup,</hi> or he muſt ſtarve; and to ſtay for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from the Attorney General, becauſe there was new Work to be done, ſuch as his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would not ſerve him to do; that there
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:152694:125"/>was more Roguery, that they would never have done plotting and counter-plotting; but that they would make a thouſand Plots if they could to deſtroy the real One: But this he could not prove, becauſe it was to him alone he ſaid it.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner call'd then Mr. <hi>Alexander Blake,</hi> who ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> told him one Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That one <hi>Haynes</hi> was under Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and had diſcovered very material things againſt ſome great Perſons; which, ſome time after he told was a Sham-Plot, a Meal-tub Plot.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Samuel Smith</hi> was call'd, who own'd his acquaintance with <hi>Smith,</hi> and that he had heard him ſay he believed a Popiſh Plot, but not any Proteſtant Plot; and that, though he denied not but that he had ſworn againſt Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> he did not believe what <hi>Colledge</hi> had ſaid, for he did not believe it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Thomas Gardner</hi> being call'd, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the ſame; <hi>Smith</hi> repeating it in his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with Mr. <hi>Samuel Smith</hi> at the <hi>Rummer</hi> in <hi>Queen's-ſtreet:</hi> And withal, that two or three of the Jury-men that acquitted Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> were Raſcals and Villains: And, ſays he, they talk as if I intended to ſham the Popiſh Plot, and make a Proteſtant Plot; which, ſaid he, I vow to God, and I will juſtify it before God and all the World, that I know of no Proteſtant Plot, nor is there any Proteſtant concerned in a Plot to my knowledg but this <hi>Colledge,</hi> and upon his Trial I believe he will be made
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:152694:126"/>appear to be more a Papiſt than a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
               <p>Then the Priſoner call'd for Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> again, to give an Account to the Court what treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Words he heard ſpoke at Alderman <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cox</hi>'s Treat at the Crown-Tavern without <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Bar:</hi> Who appearing again, did affirm, That the Diſcourſe, between the Coffee-Houſe and the Tavern, was between Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> and him, and not at all with <hi>Smith,</hi> who either went before, or followed them; and that when he heard <hi>Smith</hi> ſwear at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> that it was with him, he did really in his Conſcience look upon him as forſworn in that Particular. That at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Diſcourſe was between him and one Mr. <hi>Savage,</hi> who had been formerly a Romiſh Prieſt, concerning the Exiſtence of God, and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul. That <hi>Colledge</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi> had no Diſcourſe at all together in his hearing, and that immediatly after Dinner <hi>Smith</hi> went his way.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> a Lawyer was call'd, who ſaid, That he was at Dinner, but heard no treaſonable Words ſpoke, moſt of the Diſcourſe being between Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Savage;</hi> and that if there had been any ſuch words ſpoke, he muſt needs have heard them, the Room being ſmall; and for that Reaſon, that they could not divide themſelves into Cabals, (as <hi>Smith</hi> had depoſed) but that <hi>Colledge</hi> was aſleep moſt of the time. And as to Arms, he knew that Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> uſed to ride with Piſtols, having bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed his Horſe, and had them; and that he ſaw a Silk Armour, which <hi>Colledge</hi> told him he
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:152694:126"/>did provide againſt the Papiſts, for, he ſaid, he did expect we ſhould have a Bruſh with them; however, that this would do no harm.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Samuel Oates,</hi> Dr <hi>Oates</hi>'s Brother, was called, who teſtified, That he was alſo at this Dinner, and that Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> walk'd with him, and his Brother from the Coffee-houſe to the Tavern; and that <hi>Smith</hi> followed them. That he ſaw neither Cabals, nor did he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that <hi>Colledge</hi> ſlept, or that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Savage</hi> diſcours'd ſo together; nor heard he any treaſonable words ſpoke, but only common Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> being called, appeared, and declared, That on <hi>July</hi> 25. laſt, as he, Mr. <hi>Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi> were travelling from <hi>York</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>London, Smith</hi> asked him, If he did not remember that Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> told him, at <hi>Ferry-Bridge,</hi> when they were coming before to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that there would be cutting of Throats at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that the Parliament did go provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſome with eight, ſome with ſix, ſome with four Men, and they were to meet at <hi>Grantham</hi> and go together? To which he replied, that he remembred Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> ſaid, They went with Horſe and Arms to ſecure them from High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Men; and that the Diſcourſe was, there would be cutting of Throats at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which made them go with Arms to defend themſelves. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> told him he had given his Majeſty an Account of it, which occaſioned the Diſſolving of the Parliament. And that he had given a further Account, that there was to be a Conſult at <hi>Grantham,</hi> wherein it was reſolved, That it
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:152694:127"/>was better to ſeize the King, than to let him go on. That <hi>Smith</hi> would have perſwaded him to have given in the ſame Evidence; and ſaid, That if he did manage it rightly againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and <hi>Colledge,</hi> he would make him for ever: Further telling him, that he muſt ſay ſo and ſo; for if they did not agree, it would ſignify nothing. And that he diſcovered this to my Lord-Mayor ſoon after he came to Town.</p>
               <p>Then the Attorney General asked Mr. <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> if he knew any thing of any Pictures of Mr. <hi>Colledges</hi> making, or had ſeen the <hi>Rary Show?</hi> Who replied, That he had ſeen the Character of a Popiſh Succeſſor, but never the other.</p>
               <p>Whereupon one Mr. <hi>Charlett,</hi> a Maſter of Arts of <hi>Trinity-Colledge,</hi> was ſworn, who depoſed, That Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> had ſhewn him, in a Coffee-Houſe in <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Pictures of the <hi>Tantivies</hi> and <hi>Towzer,</hi> and told him they were made by <hi>Colledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> only owned, that he had ſeen the Character of a Popiſh Succeſſor. And then proceeded to declare concerning <hi>Hains,</hi> that he had been ſeveral times in his Company, in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, February,</hi> and <hi>April</hi> laſt, and had heard him ſay, he knew nothing of a Popiſh Plot, nor of a Presbyterian Plot neither; but if he were to be an Evidence, he did not care what he ſwore, but would ſwear and ſay any thing to get Mony; That to day he would be a Papiſt, to morrow a Presbyterian, he did not care for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; he would never die for Religion, he would be of that Religion that had the ſtrongeſt Party.</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:152694:127"/>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Mowbray</hi> was called, who atteſted to <hi>Smith</hi>'s Diſcourſe on the Road, and that he would have drawn him in to be an Evidence againſt Sir <hi>John Brooks,</hi> whom he had no acquaintance with, nor came he up with him; on which he applied himſelf to Mr. <hi>Bolron.</hi> Then Serj. <hi>Jefferies</hi> asked him when they ſet out from <hi>York?</hi> and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the 3d of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which diſagreeing with the Time Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> had ſpoke to, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant failed not to make his uſual flouriſhes upon it, though Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi>'s Almanack did ſufficiently prove it his miſtake. However the Court failed not to reprove his raſh Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. <hi>Bolron,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi>'s Wife was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, who only ſaid, That within three Weeks ſince <hi>Smith</hi> came up from <hi>York</hi>-Aſſizes, he ſent ſeveral times to her Houſe for her Husband and Mr. <hi>Mowbray,</hi> to have them concerned with him in ſome Buſineſs he had in hand; that now and then they have gone to him, but they knew his Buſineſs, becauſe they had Diſcourſe with him, as they ſaid, upon the Road, and they would not go.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> was call'd, who ſaid, He had been to ſee Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> very lately, and he told him, he knew of no Presbyterian or Proteſtant Plot; and that when my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was tried, that is, the Bill brought againſt him, he ſaid, He wondered how my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> could be Guilty, and that both himſelf and he were joined as Evidence to that Jury, only to put a gloſs upon the Evidence, for, ſaid he, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing material to ſay.</p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:152694:128"/>
               <p>And further, to prove a Deſign of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to turn a Plot upon the Proteſtants, Mr. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verard</hi> declared that Juſtice <hi>Warcup</hi> would have perſwaded him to have ſworn againſt ſome Lords a Presbyterian Plot, but he denied that he knew any ſuch thing of them. And concerning <hi>Haynes</hi> he ſaid, That he told him that it was Neceſſity only that drove him to ſpeak any thing againſt the Proteſtants: For he had but ſhort Pay; and it was Self-preſervation, becauſe he being brought in Guilty when he was taken up, he was obliged to do ſomething to ſave his Life. And it was a Judgment impending upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either upon the King or People, he knew not which: But theſe Iriſh Mens ſwearing againſt them, was juſtly fallen upon them, for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice againſt the Iriſh in outing them their Eſtates.</p>
               <p>Then the Court was acquainted that Mr. <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cup</hi> was juſt come in, and deſired to vindicate himſelf. But it was waved, ſaying, There was no weight in it. Nor was Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> allowed to make any further Diſcovery of ſhamming the Plot upon the Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Thomas Parkhurſt</hi> was called, who could only ſay, That in <hi>November</hi> laſt being with Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and Mr. <hi>Symonds,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>'s Houſe, he ſaw there ſome few Arms, which he ſaid he had provided for his ſecurity againſt the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Symonds</hi> being called, declared the very ſame Story: Whence the Priſoner inferred, That his Arms were not prepared for his <hi>Oxford</hi> Expedition, this being before that Parliament was called.</p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:152694:128"/>
               <p>Then one Mr. <hi>Yates,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> had employed to make a Piſtol for Mr. <hi>Colledge,</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, That three Weeks after the <hi>Oxford</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, he heard Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſay, in diſcourſe of <hi>Colledge,</hi> that he believed him to be an honeſt Man, and one that ſtood up for the Good of the King and the Government.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Clayton,</hi> at whoſe Houſe Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> lodg'd while he was in <hi>Oxford,</hi> teſtified, that Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> brought no Arms to his Houſe, but one Sword by his Side, and a pair of Piſtols in his Holſters; and that he never ſaw Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> in Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Company in his Houſe.</p>
               <p>Then ſeveral from <hi>Watford</hi> in <hi>Hartford-ſhire,</hi> the Town wherein Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> was born, and ſome others, appeared for him, and teſtified to his civil Behaviour, and that he was a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> declared to the Court con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Papers that had been charged upon him, that they were none of his, nor did he ever own them for his, nor could he ever make Pictures nor did he ever in his Life; and that that very Perſon whom Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſaid he owned he got it to be printed by, had denied it before the King and Council.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Elizabeth Hunt</hi> the Priſoner's ſervant, appeared, who teſtified, That about 7 or 8 Weeks before the ſeizure of the Papers, a Porter brought three Bundles of Papers for her Maſter, in his abſence, which lay in a Box in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-houſe a Week or Fortnight before ſhe told him of them. And as to Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> that ſhe going to him for Mony he owed her Maſter,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:152694:129"/>after he was in Priſon, and he not paying her it as he promiſed, ſhe ſaid to him, Sir I think 'tis very hard that you ſhould keep my Maſter's Mony from him, and yet go and ſwear againſt his Life too; he ſaid to her, There was a great deal of do about his ſwearing againſt her Maſter, more than needs; but as he hoped for Salvation, he did not believe Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> had any more hand in any Conſpiracy againſt his Majeſty, than the Child unborn.—Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> inform'd the Court, that this Maid moreover told him in the <hi>Tower,</hi> before he came away, that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> deſired to be remembred to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> (<hi>Colledge</hi>'s Counſel) and told her he had nothing againſt her Maſter that could touch his Life, or an Hair of his Head; and that he knew nothing of a Plot againſt the King; and that if he could help it, he had as lieve he had given 100 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> he had never ſpoken what he had.— Which ſhe own'd for truth, and <hi>Dugdale</hi> then denied, evading it by telling the Story another way.</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. <hi>Godwin</hi> being called, appeared, who related concerning the Papers, that three Meſſengers coming to ſearch for them on the <hi>Saturday</hi> after her Brother's confinement, and they not finding them, ſhe got her Brother-in-law, <hi>George Spur,</hi> to carry them away to his Houſe at <hi>Busſhie,</hi> to ſecure them, till they ſhould know what they did concern.—Then <hi>Spur</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called, did not appear.</p>
               <p>Then the Attorny General called for one <hi>John Shirland,</hi> who appeared to be a Man that lived by his Shifts, and had been whip'd in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:152694:129"/>
                  <hi>Bridewel,</hi> who ſwore, that Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> would have given him 10 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and an Horſe, to go down and ſwear againſt Sir <hi>Miles Stapleton:</hi> Which <hi>Bolron</hi> denied.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Smith</hi> depoſed likewiſe againſt Mr. <hi>Bolron,</hi> that he told him, as they were traveling, that he had as much to ſay againſt <hi>Colledge</hi> as any Body; and that if he would ſpeak for him, he would evidence againſt Sir <hi>John Brooks</hi> for a diſcourſe at <hi>Ferry-Bridge.</hi> Which Mr. <hi>Bolron</hi> deny'd likewiſe. Then no more Witneſſes being called, Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> began to make his Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Evidence to the Court; Profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Innocency as to what had been ſworn againſt him; and upon what had been atteſted for him, owning his Zeal for his King, Parliaments, Church of <hi>England,</hi> and againſt Popery. Relating how he came acquainted with <hi>Haynes,</hi> and the diſcoveries he made to him of the Popiſh Plot, and of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi>'s Murder (for which the Court interrupted and reproved him, as not to the purpoſe) and then he went on to ſum up his own Evidence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of his cloſe Confinement, ſo that he could not procure that Evidence he otherwiſe might have done for himſelf. The Statute of <hi>Decimo tertio</hi> was read to him; and then Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> very pathetically recommending himſelf to the Juſtice of his Jury, concluded his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Sollicitor General, largely ſumm'd up the Evidence, and Mr. Serjeant <hi>Jefferies,</hi> and the Lord Chief Juſtice did the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:152694:130"/>
               <p>Then the Court called for two Bottles of Sack, which the Jury divided among themſelves at the Bar, for their Refreſhment in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Priſoner. After which a Bailiff was ſworn, and the Jury withdrawing to conſider of their Verdict, the Court adjourned for half an hour, and when they returned, the Jury brought the Priſoner in <hi>Guilty.</hi> At which there was a great Shout given; whereat the Court being offended, one Perſon who was obſerved by the Cryer to be particularly concerned in the Shout, was committed to Goal for that Night, but the next Morning having received a publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, was diſcharged without Fees. Then it being about 3 a Clock in the Morning, the Court adjourned to 10. At which hour the Court being ſat, and firſt Mr. <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> having entred into a Recognizance of 500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the firſt day of the next Term, at the Court of <hi>King's-Bench;</hi> the Lord Chief-Juſtice, after a ſhort ſpeech directed to the Priſoner, pronounced Sentence upon him, to be <hi>Hang'd, Drawn,</hi> and <hi>Quartered;</hi> which was accordingly executed upon him, over againſt the Gate of the Caſtle at <hi>Oxford,</hi> on Wedneſday, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 31. 1681. And his Head and Quarters (through his Majeſty's Grace) were delivered to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and by them brought up to <hi>London,</hi> and privately interred.</p>

               <p>THE Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pemberton</hi> gave the Charge; wherein he explained the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Treaſon, particularly from the Statute of the 13th <hi>Car.</hi> 2. and explained the Validity of two Witneſſes, and the Jury's preſent Duty. After which, a Bill of High-Treaſon was offered againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Withens</hi> moved, That the Evidence might be heard in Court. Then the Jury deſired a Copy of their Oath, which the Court granted, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:152694:131"/>then they withdrew. After ſome little time they returned, and being called over by their Names, The <hi>Foreman</hi> acquainted the Lord Chief Juſtice, That it was the Opinion of the Jury, and they claim'd, as their Right, that they ought to examine the Witneſſes in private. But the Lord Chief Juſtice deny'd that it was their Right, but was their Advantage; and it was the King's deſire it ſhould be publick; in which alſo the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>North</hi> concurr'd; and then therefore the Indictment was read, wherein the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was charged with High-Treaſon, for conſpiring the Death of the King, and ſubverſion of the Government.</p>
               <p>The Jury then deſired a Liſt of the Names of the King's Evidence: But they were told, that they being indorſed upon the back of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, which they were to have out with them, it was needleſs. Then they requeſted to ſee the Warrant by which the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was committed; but that, they being told that the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> kept for his Indemnity, could not be granted. Then they requeſted that the Evidence might be put apart and examined one by one; which was granted.</p>

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> appeared, and delivered in a Paper, depoſing, that it was put into his Cuſtody by Mr. <hi>Gwyn,</hi> Clerk of the Council, who ſeiz'd it among others in my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Houſe, and brought them to the Council-Office, put them into one of the Rooms, look'd the Door, and deliver'd the Key to him. And being ordered by the Committee of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:152694:131"/>he fetch'd up the Trunks and Papers into the Council-Chamber; and this Paper he took out of a Velvet Bag which was in the great Trunk that was ſealed, and then opened on <hi>July</hi> 6. in the preſence of Mr. <hi>Samuel Wilſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Starkey,</hi> who were both appointed by the Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Gwyn</hi> being called, depoſed, That on <hi>July</hi> 2. by a Warrant from the Secretary, he ſearched the Lord <hi>Shaftſbury</hi>'s Houſe for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers where was a great Hair-Trunk, in which were ſeveral ſorts of them; and a Velvet Bag, into which he put ſome looſe Papers, and ſealed up the Trunk; and, being ſent another way, he deliver'd it to Mr. <hi>Blathwayt;</hi> That all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that were in the Velvet Bag, he had in my Lord's Cloſet; and that nothing was in that Bag but what he had there, when he delivered it to Mr. <hi>Blathwayt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> depoſed, That that was the Paper that Mr. <hi>Blathwayt</hi> delivered into his Hands in the Council-Chamber, with nine more, which he had kept under Lock and Key ever ſince, till Monday laſt, when he took them out; and being numbred, ſent them ſealed to Mr. <hi>Graham,</hi> who brought them back to him again without any alteration whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The Paper then was read, which was to this effect. <q>That We the Knights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> finding, to the grief of our Hearts, the Papiſts Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances againſt the Proteſtant Religion, the Life of the King, and Laws and Liberties of the Nation, to ſet up Arbitrary Power and Slavery. And it being notorious that they have received
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:152694:132"/>Encouragement and Protection from <hi>James</hi> D. of <hi>York,</hi> and from their Expectations of his ſucceeding to the Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that by his Influences, Mercenary Forces have been levied, Parliaments unreaſonably Prorogued and Diſſolved, and the Army and Ammunition put into the hands of his Party, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Treaſure of the Kingdom hereby waſted;—That therefore they endeavoured to Exclude him from the Succeſſion to the Crown;—and that failing, they have now thought fit to propoſe to all true Proteſtants an Union amongſt themſelves, by ſolemn and ſacred Promiſe of mutual Defence and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, in the Preſervation of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, the King's Perſon and State, and our Laws, Liberties and Properties, in a Declaration in the Form enſuing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which was to this effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Perſon ſwears to maintain the Proteſtant Religion againſt Popery. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The King's Perſon and State; as alſo the Power and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliaments, Rights and Liberties of Subjects, <hi>&amp;c. Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>J.</hi> D. of <hi>Y.</hi> having profeſs'd himſelf a Papiſt, and given Life to the Plot, that therefore he would oppoſe his, or any other Papiſt's coming to the Crown, by all lawful Means, and by force of Arms, if need ſo require, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To this end they mutually obliged one another to purſue unto deſtruction all that oppoſe the Ends of this Aſſociation, and to defend all that enter into it; And do engage, that they will obey ſuch Orders as they ſhall from time
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:152694:132"/>to time receive from this preſent Parliament, whilſt it ſhall be ſitting, or the major part of the Members of both Houſes ſubſcribing this Aſſociation, when it ſhall be Prorogued or Diſſolved: and obey ſuch Officers as ſhall by them be ſet over them in their ſeveral Counties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> until the next meeting of Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—And that they would ſtick to this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation during Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In witneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Never a Hand was to this Paper. Which being read, and briefly deſcanted upon by the Counſel for the King, <hi>John Booth</hi> was then called forth, who depoſed, That about the middle of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> laſt, be was introduced into the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury's</hi> Acquaintance by Captain <hi>Henry Wilkinſon,</hi> (a <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Gentleman, an old Royaliſt, and an old Acquaintance of his) about ſome Concern relating to <hi>Carolina.</hi> After which he went frequently to my Lord's Houſe, and between <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> and <hi>March</hi> four or five times; Where he hath heard him ſharply inveigh againſt the Times, and thought himſelf under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, and feared that Popery would be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. And that the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament, that was then ſhortly to meet, would give the King no Mony, unleſs he would ſatisfy them in what they would inſiſt upon; which, he ſaid, would be the Bill of the Excluſion, and the aboliſhing the Statute of the 35th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and paſſing a New Bill to free the Diſſenters from the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Laws, which, if refuſed, would make a Breach between the King and Parliament; whoſe meeting at <hi>Oxford</hi> was deſigned only to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:152694:133"/>over-awe them; And therefore that himſelf, and divers Noble Lords, and Members of the Commons had conſidered their own Safety; and that he had eſtabliſh'd a matter of fifty Men, Perſons of Quality, that he believed would have Men along with them; and he intruſted Capt. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> with the Command of theſe Men, who were to come to <hi>Oxford</hi> at ſuch a time; and if there were any Breach or Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, they were to be ready to aſſiſt him and thoſe other Perſons in his Confederacy, to purge the Guards of all Papiſts and Tories, and purge from the King thoſe evil Counſellors which were about him; naming, the Earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the Lord <hi>Clarendon,</hi> the Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> Lord <hi>Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hide,</hi> now Lord Viſcount <hi>Hide;</hi> whom he look'd upon as dangerous Perſons; and then to bring the King away to <hi>London,</hi> where thoſe things ſhould be eſtabliſhed which they deſigned for the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, and keeping out of Arbitrary Power and Government. Upon which Capt. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> deſired him to be one under his Command, and to provide Horſe and Arms, to which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and did ſo; expecting to be ſent for after the Parliament was ſat, they inſiſting upon the things the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted; but the unexpected News of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution prevented it.—Then, being ask'd when he firſt diſcovered this, he anſwered about ſix Weeks ago; and related the occaſion and manner of his doing ſo.</p>
               <p>Next, Mr. <hi>Edward Turbervile</hi> depoſed, That in <hi>February</hi> laſt, he waiting upon the Lord
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:152694:133"/>
                  <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> about his getting ſome Mony, and requeſting his Letter to the Preſident of the Council to ſtand his Friend, my Lord ſaid, There was little good to be had from the King, as long as his Guards were about him; were it not for whom, they would quickly go down to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and obtain what terms they thought fit.—And that the Rabble were all of that Side, eſpecially the People about <hi>Wapping,</hi> and <hi>Alderſgate-Street;</hi> That the Rich Men of the City would Vote for Elections, but they could not expect they ſhould ſtand by them in caſe there ſhould be any Diſturbance, for they valued their Riches more than their Cauſe. And at <hi>Oxford,</hi> that he heard my Lord ſay again, He wondred the People of <hi>England</hi> ſhould ſtickle ſo much about Religion; if he were to chooſe a Religion, he would have one that ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with what was apt to carry on their Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>John Smith</hi> depoſed, That he had often, both in publick and private, heard the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſpeak very irreverently and ſlightly of the King, ſaying, He was a weak Man, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant Man, of no firm or ſettled Reſolution; eaſily led by the Noſe, as his Father was before him, by a Popiſh Queen, which was the Ruin of his Father.—And that the King ſhould declare, That the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was not ſatisfied to be an ill Man himſelf, but got over the E. of <hi>Eſſex</hi> too.—And that he was the chief promoter of the Rebellion in <hi>Scotland;</hi> which when it was told him, that he ſhould ſend back word to the King, That he was glad that the King ſaw not his own Danger,—But if he were to raiſe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:152694:134"/>he could raiſe another-gueſs Rebellion than was that in <hi>Scotland.</hi>—One time particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, being ſent for to the Lord <hi>Shaftsburies,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his jealouſy of the Iriſh Witneſſes being drawn over to the Court-Party, and retracting what they had ſaid, he order'd him to perſuade them from going nigh that Rogue <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> maintain'd by the King and Court-Party to ſtifle the Plot in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Saying alſo, That when he was in the <hi>Tower,</hi> he told ſome, he ſaw Popery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and that it was hard to prevent it.— And that if the King were not as well ſatisfied with the coming in of Popery as ever the D. of <hi>York</hi> was, the D. would not be ſo much concern'd about it as he was.—Afterwards having execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my Lord's Order, one Mr. <hi>Bernard Dennis</hi> gave in an Information before Sir <hi>Patience Ward,</hi> Lord-Mayor, againſt <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> that he had tamper'd with him to forſwear all he had ſworn before; the Copy of which Information he brought to the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> who when he had read it, was very well pleaſed with it, and ſaid, Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> don't you ſee the Villany of that Man, and that factious Party, and that the King runs the ſame ſteps as his Father did before him, for that nothing of this Nature could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be done. I, ſays he, theſe are the very Steps that his Father followed when he was led by his Popiſh Queen, and the poor Man doth not ſee his Danger.—Another time, before the Parliament went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> in diſcourſe, my Lord was ſaying to him, That there was great Preparations made, and a great many gathered together upon the Road between <hi>London</hi> and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:152694:134"/>
                  <hi>Oxford,</hi> which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſaid, was to terrify the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to comply with the King's Deſire, which he was ſure they never would, for that the King aimed to bring in Popery: But, ſaid he, we have this Advantage of him, if he offer any Violence to us, (for we expect it) that we have the Nation for us, and we may lawfully oppoſe him, for it has been done in former Times, and he will meet with a very ſtrong Oppoſition; for all that come out of the Country, ſhall be well Hors'd and well Arm'd, and ſo we ſhall be all; and as old as he was, that he would be one that would oppoſe to his Power, and die before he would ever bring in Popery, or any thing of that Nature.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Brian Haines</hi> depoſed, That he had often heard the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> vilify the King. And that he and Mr. <hi>Ivey</hi> going to him one day, about the Narrative he made of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi>'s Death, he deſired him not to expoſe his Perſon to the King's Anger, becauſe he was ſure he would never grant a Pardon to any Man that impeached the Earl of <hi>Danby:</hi> Says he, Do not fear, if he does not grant you a Pardon, he makes himſelf the Author of the Plot; and, ſays he, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Lord <hi>Maxfield</hi> and I, we do all reſolve if you'l put in a Writing, we will go to the King, and beg a Pardon of him for you; which if he does not grant, we will raiſe the whole Kingdom againſt him; for he muſt not expect to live peaceably in his Throne it he doth not grant it; and this is the beſt Pretence we can have in the World,—we are prepar'd to raiſe Arms againſt him.—And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:152694:135"/>(having heard a Pardon could not be had, being begg'd for by the two Mr. <hi>Godfries</hi>) he praying my Lord for a little Mony to help him to go beyond-Sea, becauſe he was ſure he could not be ſafe in <hi>England.</hi> My Lord told him, the King durſt as well be hang'd as meddle with him.—And one Day he being in Conference, and giving my Lord an exact Account of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, (having been a Traveller) he asked my Lord, What Model of Government was deſigned, if they pulled the King down? Says he, Do you think there are no Families in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> that have as much pretence to the Crown as any of the <hi>Stewarts?</hi> Says he, There is the Duke of <hi>Bucks,</hi> that is deſcended of the Family of the <hi>Plantagenets,</hi> one of the <hi>Edwards</hi> by his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in her Right he ſhould have the Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Roſs,</hi> and has as good a Title to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> as ever any <hi>Stewart</hi> had.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>John Macnamarra</hi> being ſworn, depoſed, That he being with the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> after his return from the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Proviſion for the Witneſſes; he heard him expreſs himſelf, That the King was Popiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affected, and did adhere to Popery, taking the ſame Methods that his Father before him took, which brought his Father's Head to the Block; and that they would alſo bring his thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that he had told ſome Perſons of Quality that this would fall out five Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.—And at the ſame time that he ſaid, the King was a Faithleſs Man, and no Credit was to be given to him; and that the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mazarine</hi> was of his Cabinet-Council, who was
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:152694:135"/>the worſt Woman-kind.—And that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be depoſed as much as ever King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the Second did.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Dennis Macnamarra</hi> depoſed, That he alſo heard the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſay, in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April,</hi> in his own Houſe, Mr. <hi>Ivey</hi> being preſent, That the King was not to be believe, there was no Belief in him, and he ought to be depoſed as well a King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second; and that the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mazarine</hi> was of his Cabinet-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and he nothing but by her Conſent.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Edward Ivey</hi> depoſed, That being at my Lord's Houſe, ſoon after the Parliament was diſſolved at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he heard him ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, ſaying, He was an unjuſt Man, and unfit to Reign; and he wondred her did not take Example by his Father before him, and that he was a Papiſt in his Heart, and intended to introduce Popery. And afterwards being with him with <hi>Hains,</hi> he bid <hi>Hains</hi> to put what he had to ſay about the Death of Sir <hi>Edmondbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> into writing, and he ſhould have a Pardon; and that if the King did deny it, as he durſt not, they would riſe upon him and force him.</p>
               <p>After him <hi>Bernard Dennis</hi> being ſworn, gave ſome account of his firſt coming into <hi>England,</hi> and how he began his Acquaintance with the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and was recommended by him (underſtanding him to be a Clergy-Man) to Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> and afterward to Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> in order to the bringing him over; and how my Lord proffer'd him a Benefice.—And that one time being with him, my Lord asked him, How many there might be of his Name in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:152694:136"/>and told him, that he would have him to adviſe thoſe of his Name, and Friends, to be in a readineſs when-ever occaſion ſhall ſerve, to ſtand by and aſſiſt the Common-Wealth of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for that they did really intend to have <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> under a Common-Wealth, and would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate the King, and all his Family, as near as they could. And ſaid, he admir'd at the Iriſh Nation to be ſuch Fools; for that it was very certain, that King <hi>James,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and the King that now is does wrong them to very Deſtruction;—But that a Common-Wealth would take more pity of them than any do now, in this time wherein the King governs.</p>
               <p>Here the King's Evidence ceaſing, the Jury enquired upon what Statute the Indictment was grounded; and whether any of theſe Witneſſes ſtood indicted? To which the Court returning a ſatisfactory Anſwer, they withdrew, and the Court adjourned till three of the Clock.—When being ſat again, the Witneſſes were all called one by one, and examined by the Jury concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they had ſeverally depoſed. Wherein nothing was remarkable, but what they examin'd Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins,</hi> Whether he heard not a Debate in the Houſe of Commons about an <hi>Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation?</hi>—And that <hi>Booth</hi> acknowledged himſelf to be in Orders, tho now not Beneficed.—<hi>Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> and <hi>John Macnamarra,</hi> that though they ſigned the Petition to the Common-Council, (for ſome Maintenance, and that they were tempted to revoke their Evidence) yet never read it, nor knew what was in it.—And that <hi>Haynes</hi> further
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:152694:136"/>ſaid, That he heard the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſay, at a Paſtry-Cook's Shop in <hi>Iron-Monger Lane,</hi> that the King had no more Religion than an Horſe;—That when he came came firſt to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he was inclined to Popery, but ſince he was degenerated from all the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, being juſt like a perfect Beaſt.</p>
               <p>The Witneſſes being examined, the Jury withdrew, and took the Statute-Book with them, and returned the Bill <hi>Ignoramus:</hi> Upon which the People fell a Hollowing and Shouting; which Mr. Attorn. Gen. deſired might be recorded.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> the Chirurgeon depoſed, That he was with Mr. <hi>Thynn,</hi> about nine or ten a Clock that Night he was wounded, and found him ſhot with four Bullets, which entred into his Body, tore his Guts, and wounded his Liver, and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and Gall, and broke one of his Ribs, and wounded the great Bone below; of which Wounds he died, and believed there as never a Wound but was Mortal. He ſhewed the Court the four Bullets, two of which he thought might be Iron; one he found in the Stomach, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Ribs and the Skin, and two were lodged in the Back-bone.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>White</hi> the Coroner depoſed, That on <hi>Feb.</hi> 13. he ſat upon the Body, and found four Holes on the right Side, behind his ſhort Ribbs, as if made with Bullets; and he gave order to open the Body, and ſaw Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> take out the four Bullets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boresky</hi> being then told what was ſaid, replied, That he fired the Blunderbuſs, but did not know how many Bullets there were, becauſe he did not charge it, but he could tell who did: But the Ld. Ch. Juſtice ſaid, that would not be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, becauſe his Evidence could charge no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but himſelf.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Bridgman,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Reresby</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, That <hi>Borosky, Vratz,</hi> and <hi>Stern,</hi> were examined by them: and proffer'd to read their Examinations, but the Ld. Ch. Juſtice would not
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:152694:138"/>ſuffer it, becauſe their Evidence could charge no Body but themſelves; and he would not let the Jury be poſſeſs'd by that which is not Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And therefore they were only ſuffer'd to help their Memories by the Examinations, and to mention only what they had confeſſed as to themſelves. Therefore they ſaid that <hi>Borosky</hi> then confeſſed, that he came into <hi>England</hi> at the deſire of Count <hi>Conningsmark,</hi> [But here the Ld. Ch. Juſtice interrupted again the Evidence, and bid Mr. <hi>Bridgman</hi> only relate his Confeſſion as to himſelf; which was] That he fired the Muſquetoon by the Captain's Order, who had before bid him to fire as ſoon as ever he ſtopped the Coach. Capt. <hi>Vratz</hi> confeſſed that he came with a Deſign to fight Mr. <hi>Thynn,</hi> having ſent him Challenges by Poſt from <hi>Holland,</hi> for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill of Count <hi>Conningſmark,</hi> who was his Friend, and of himſelf, at <hi>Richmond;</hi> and that he could never receive Satisfaction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came to force him to fight; and took the other two with him, as his Servants, Mr. <hi>Thynn</hi> being a Gentleman that had always a great many Servants about him to carry-him off, in caſe he ſhould be knock'd on the Head, or be hindred from eſcaping, reſolving to make a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of it, becauſe Duels he underſtood were forbid in <hi>England.</hi> Owning that he did ſtop the Coach, but that the <hi>Polonian</hi> fired by miſtake, he not bidding him fire, unleſs he ſhould be hindred from fighting, or making his eſcape. That Lieutenant <hi>Stern</hi> confeſſed, that Captain <hi>Vratz</hi> told him he had a Quarrel with an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Gentleman; and that if he would aſſiſt him
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:152694:138"/>in it, he would make his Fortune, and gave him Mony to buy the Blunderbuſs; and he went out with the Captain and <hi>Polander</hi> on Horſe-back, about five or ſix a Clock on <hi>Sunday;</hi> and when they were got into the <hi>Pall-mall,</hi> he heard the Captain ſay to the Coachman, <hi>Stop;</hi> and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately, being then nine or ten Yards before the Coach, he ſaw the Shot go off, and they riding away, he followed them. And that before the <hi>Polander</hi> came over, the Captain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to get an <hi>Italian</hi> to ſtab a Man.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Frederick Hanſon</hi> (Governour to Count <hi>Conningſmark</hi>'s younger Brother in his Travels) depoſed, That he ſaw the Count at the Poſt-houſe, when he arrived, which was about a Month ſince; his firſt Lodgings he took in the <hi>Hay-Market,</hi> where he was about a week <hi>incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Carlo Cusk;</hi> thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to another Lodging, though but for a few Days becauſe the Chimney ſmoked; and thence he removed into St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s <hi>Lane,</hi> where he ſaw him, and particularly that Night Mr. <hi>Thynn</hi> was kill'd, where his Phyſician was with him, and Capt. <hi>Vratz,</hi> who came into <hi>England</hi> with the Count. Then being ask'd about the Meſſage he carried from the Count to the Swediſh Reſident; he very difficultly and ſhufflingly (tho he was ſhewed his Examination before the Council) acknowledg'd that the Count had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd to him about calling Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and what the Laws of <hi>England</hi> would be in caſe he did; and deſired Monſieur <hi>Lienberg</hi>'s Opinion concerning it, and eſpecially in relation to the Lady <hi>Ogle.</hi> That the <hi>Polander</hi> was
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:152694:139"/>brought to him on the Friday, and the next Morning he brought him to the Count's Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and as employed to buy a Coat and Sword for him; which he did. That the next Evening, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> coming from <hi>White-hall,</hi> he call'd of the <hi>Count,</hi> and told him the News of Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi>'s Murder, and that the Count asked him, what the People ſaid? he ſaid the King was heartily ſorry, and angry at it.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>John Wright</hi> depoſed, That the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> came into <hi>England</hi> the 10th day of this Month, and he brought him the ſame day to young Count <hi>Conningſmark</hi>'s Lodging, at <hi>Faubert</hi>'s Academy, to Mr. <hi>Hanſon,</hi> who after half an hours Diſcourſe with the Polander, deſired him to take him back with him again, and bring him betimes to him again the next morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he muſt diſpatch him about his Buſineſs. He did accordingly, and the <hi>Polander</hi> carried with him his Sea-bed, a Portmantle, and a Gun with a Wheel-lock, and ſome other things, and went to an Ale-houſe hard by the Academy, and the <hi>Polander</hi> ſtepping out, fetch'd Mr. <hi>Hanſon,</hi> who paying him for his trouble, he never ſaw them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Then Dr. <hi>Frederick Harder</hi> depoſed, That when the Count came firſt to Town, he ſent for him by Capt. <hi>Vratz;</hi> that he found the Count then indiſpos'd, and willing therefore to lie <hi>incognito</hi> that he might take Phyſick, which he adminiſter'd to him. That on the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day he brought the <hi>Polander</hi> to the Count's Lodgings to Capt. <hi>Vratz,</hi> and at the ſame time ſhew'd the Count a Letter from Capt. <hi>Vratz,</hi>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:152694:139"/>which he ſaid was only that he ſhould come and ſpeak with the Count: That on Sunday night, about 9 a Clock, he was with the Count again, and Mr. <hi>Hanſon</hi> was there, and Captain <hi>Vratz</hi> for a little while, but that they knew nothing of the Murder then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Howgood</hi> depoſed, That he ſold the Sword on the Saturday to Mr. <hi>Hanſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Robert French</hi> depoſed, That the Count lodged at his Houſe 3 or 4 days in the <hi>Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market,</hi> where the Doctor and the Captain came oft to him, but he did not then know who he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ann Prince</hi> (Mr. <hi>French</hi>'s Maid) depoſed, That the Count lodged from Friday to Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day at her Maſters, and that Capt. <hi>Vratz</hi> uſed to lodg there too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Francis Watts,</hi> a Boy of about 15 Years old, depoſed, That he was hired to wait upon the Count, and was with him eleven days: That he ſaw the <hi>Polander</hi> with his Maſter on the Saturday, and dined there with the Servants, and lodged that Night in the Garret; That on the Sunday Morning Mr. <hi>Hanſon</hi> ſent a Sword, which was given to the <hi>Polander.</hi> That the Count ask'd him that morning, if it were ſuffered for any to ride about the Streets on Sundays; That on Sunday morning the <hi>Polander</hi> went away with this Sword, a new Coat and Boots under his Arm, and the Doctor with him (who being called again, ſaid he could not remember whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was Saturday or Sunday Morning that he fetch'd away the <hi>Pole</hi> from the Count's); That on Monday morning, the Boy told the Count
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:152694:140"/>one of the Murderers was taken; after which, a Stranger came in, and he never ſaw his Maſter afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Watts</hi> (the Boy's Father) depoſed, That on Monday Morning the Count's Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd to him 2 Portmanteau's to carry to <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> where they were put into a Coach; he telling him, they were going for <hi>Windſor,</hi> but that he did not ſee the Count that morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Derick Raynes,</hi> a <hi>Swede,</hi> depoſed, That the Count lodged at his Houſe in <hi>Rotherith</hi> from Monday till Thurſday, when he went down the River for <hi>Graves-end;</hi> and borrow'd ſome Clothes of him, and ſaid, he was afraid of coming into Trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard Chappel</hi> depoſed, That he rowed the Count in a Sculler, on Thurſday to <hi>Deptford;</hi> whither <hi>Raynes</hi> went with him; and thence the next day to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and then to <hi>Greenhithe,</hi> and the next day to <hi>Graves-end;</hi> for which he was to have 5 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> every 24 Hours; the Count telling him he was a Merchant, and had bought Jewels.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Kid,</hi> depoſed, how he and Mr. <hi>Gibbons,</hi> upon information where the Count was, went on Saturday to <hi>Raynes,</hi> and thence to <hi>Graves-end,</hi> where they got on Sunday Night, and took the Count juſt as he landed, and his Cap and Perriwig then fell off; He owned his Name, and as they brought him up the Water, and diſcourſing about Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi>'s Murder, ſaying, That he had ſeen the Murderers in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate:</hi> The Count asked him, what Lodgings there
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:152694:140"/>were in <hi>Newgate,</hi> as if the Captain had a good Lodging; and confeſſed any thing? That he told him, the Captain confeſſed ſome Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; but that the <hi>Polander</hi> had confeſſed, and wept mightily; Whereupon the Count ſeemed much concern'd, and his Countenance altered, and deſired to lie down.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> depoſed, That when they had apprehended the Count, they carried him to the Mayor's, and thence to an Inn for 2 or 3 hours; and there the Count asked him his Name; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, he ſaid, he would come and give him Thanks after his Trouble was over; he owned his Name <hi>Gibbons,</hi> and that he belonged to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> Said he, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> hath no Command now, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how could he take him by his Order? He ſaid, he did not come upon his Command, but he had killed a very good Friend of his, and a Country-Man, and if Providence had not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it otherwiſe, he had killed a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friend of mine, and a Maſter, whom he had ſerved many Years. He ſaid, he did not think they would have done the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> any Injury: After which walking up and down, he ſaid, 'Twas a ſtain upon his Blood, but one good Action in the Wars, or Lodging upon a Counterſcrap will waſh away all that.—Then he asking what the People ſaid, he told him, the Captain had made a Confeſſion, (though it was a thing he did not then know) the Count ſaid he did not believe the Captain would confeſs any thing.</p>
               <p>To all this, the Count, by his Interpreter,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:152694:141"/>Sir <hi>Nathaniel Johnſon,</hi> reply'd, That he came into <hi>England</hi> with a deſign to have got a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, and ſerv'd <hi>England</hi> againſt <hi>France,</hi> hearing of an Alliance to be between <hi>England, Holland</hi> and <hi>Sweedland</hi> againſt <hi>France.</hi> That he lay <hi>incognito,</hi> becauſe he was broke out in Spots on his Arms and Breaſt, and deſigned to take Phyſick, and avoid drinking of Wine, and his Equipage was not come to him till after. That he removed his Lodgings, the firſt, becauſe it was too cold for him, and the ſecond, becauſe of a ſmoaking Chimney. That he ſent for the <hi>Polander</hi> over to dreſs his Horſes after the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> way, which he came to buy, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd 1000 Piſtols for that end, and had bought one Horſe; (which the Count's Brother teſtified)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That had it not been for the ſtormy Weather, the <hi>Polander</hi> had arrived ſooner, he having writ for him 4 Months ago. That he had no Quarrel with Mr. <hi>Thynn;</hi> nor, to the beſt of his knowledg, ever ſaw him. That it was ſtrange he ſhould ask a Scullion-boy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther People might ride on Sundays, when he himſelf over and over again has rid upon Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days to <hi>Hide-Park</hi> (which was teſtified by Major <hi>Oglethorp,</hi> and divers other Gentlemen); That Capt. <hi>Vratz</hi> viſited him on Sunday, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſick. That he gave the <hi>Polander</hi> to the Captain, becauſe he ſhould have no uſe for him himſelf; bought him Clothes, and a Sword, becauſe he wanted them. That he abſconded, becauſe one, <hi>Markham,</hi> his Taylor, told him he heard him named, as concern'd in the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that if the Common People ſhould
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:152694:141"/>catch him, they would tear him to pieces, and ſo his Friends did counſel him to withdraw. That he heard the People ſay, the Murderers follow'd Mr. <hi>Thynn</hi>'s Coach, but would not ſhoot till the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was gone out. That he ſpoke of his Apprehenſion and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, as being a ſtain to his Blood. And then the Count ſpeaking ſomething of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of his own Family, and Zeal for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and Love for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> ſumm'd up the Evidence [whereat the People made a great ſhout, but were rebuked for it by the Court] Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> did alſo the like; and then the Ld. Ch. Juſtice gave the Charge; and the <hi>Jury</hi> withdrew, and the Court Adjourned for half an hour, and then ſent for the <hi>Jury,</hi> who brought in <hi>Borosky, Vratz</hi> and <hi>Stern, Guilty,</hi> and the County <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who being diſmiſs'd, Mr. <hi>Recorder</hi> ſentenc'd the other 3 to be <hi>hang'd;</hi> Who were according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Executed in the <hi>Pall-Mall,</hi> on Friday, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10 following, and <hi>Borosky</hi> was afterwards hung up in Chains, a little beyond <hi>Mile-End,</hi> by his Majeſty's Command.</p>

               <p>After this Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> (of Counſel for the Defendants) urged, That none of the Cries or Hiſſings were fixed upon the Defendants; nor were they concerned therein, though they were there. And that it was a Queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Right of Adjourning was in the Lord-Mayor? And if not, that then here could be no Riot.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> ſpoke to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the Defendants.</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:152694:144"/>
               <p>And then Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> call'd Sir <hi>Robert Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who depoſed, That in his Mayoralty there was a Poll for the Election of Sheriffs, and that he left the management thereof, which laſted five or ſix days, wholly to the Sheriffs, as belonging to them; and that when it was adjourned, from Saturday to Monday, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it was done by them, he not thinking it did belong to any Body elſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Love</hi> then depoſed, That two and twenty Years ago he was Sheriff; and upon the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of new Sheriffs, the Lord-Mayor left the management of the Hall to him, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sheriff, bidding them look to their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, never interpoſing at all; and if he had, truly he ſhould have bid the Lord-Mayor have looked to his Office: The management of the Hall at Elections, having always been judged, in his Time, the Right of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Holt</hi> urg'd for the Defendants, That this Aſſembly, upon ſuch a Suppoſition of the Sheriffs Right, could not be made a Riot, ſo long as no Extravagances were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Wallop</hi> ſpoke to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And then Mr. Deputy <hi>Sibley</hi> depoſed, That he had been on the Livery every ſince 1639; and that he never remembred any Lord-Mayor to interpoſe in Elections till here of late, it being always left to the Sheriffs, as belonging of Right to them.</p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Winſtanley</hi> ſwore, That the Poll in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:152694:145"/>Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi>'s Time, was managed by the Sheriffs.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> depoſed only, That the Crowd was ſo great, he could ſcarce ſee one way or other.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> depoſed, That he then ſaw a matter of an hundred with their Hats upon Sticks, crying, <hi>Damn the Whigs;</hi> ſaying, the Work was done to ſtop the Poll.—</p>
               <p>Whence the Defendants Counſel inferr'd, That if there were any rudeneſs, thoſe very People that came with the Lord-Mayor were the cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>After this Mr. Attorny General called Sir <hi>Simon Lewis</hi> and Sir <hi>Jonathan Raymond,</hi> who were Sheriffs when Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> was Lord <hi>Mayor,</hi> and they both depoſed, that they took the Lord Mayor's Directions, and that he did Adjourn the Court; and they only appointed, from Day to Day, till the Pole was ended.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>James Smith,</hi> who was Sheriff the Year after Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> depoſed, That he never heard it queſtioned but that the Lord Mayor had the right of Adjourning.</p>
               <p>And then Mr. Common-Serjeant related the whole paſſage, and depoſed, That Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> did Adjourn the Court himſelf.</p>
               <p>After which Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> urged particularly in defence of the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> that he was there only accidentally, coming to Sir <hi>William Gulſton</hi> with whom he was treating about ſelling the Mannor of <hi>Corsfield</hi> in <hi>Eſſex;</hi> one Mr. <hi>Ireton</hi> who treated for him, depoſing, That there was
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:152694:145"/>ſuch a treating on foot; and that he heard of an appointment to meet again.</p>
               <p>And Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> depoſed, That he ſaw Sir <hi>William</hi> and my Lord together that night about eight a Clock.</p>
               <p>After which the Counſel for the Defendants urg'd, That the Caſe being ſo probable, their inſiſting upon it would not make it a Riot; and that the Aſſembly was not continued in a tumultuous Manner, but with a good Intent; and it could not be a Riot, unleſs there were an evil Intention to do ſome miſchief; inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Robert Atkins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. Attorny General ſumm'd up the Evidence; aſſerting that Aſſembly to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, after the Adjournment of the Lord-Mayor; and a being preſent therein, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing it, was enough to make them Guilty of the Riot.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice ſumm'd up much to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And then the Jury withdrawing for ſome time, brought in all the Defendants <hi>Guilty</hi> of the Treſpaſs and Riot.</p>

                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> of Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> for them. That the Thurſday before the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery they met at the <hi>Salutation</hi> in <hi>Lombard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> where was Captain <hi>Walcot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Weſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> the two <hi>Goodenough</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>Nelthrop,</hi> and himſelf diſcourſing about the Diviſion of the City into 20 parts, 7 of which Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> gave an account of. That on the Saturday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing they appointed another meeting at the <hi>George</hi> on <hi>Ludgate-hill;</hi> but the Diſcovery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, there met only four of them: And the Monday after the Diſcovery they met again at Capt. <hi>Tracy</hi>'s, there being the Priſoner, Mr. <hi>Weſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wade,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nelthrop,</hi> the two <hi>Goodenough</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> who exclaimed againſt <hi>Keeling,</hi> and reſolved to be gone.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> being Sworn, related, how before the King went to <hi>New-Market,</hi> he was drawn in by <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and provided <hi>Burton, Thompſon,</hi> and <hi>Barber</hi> to join in killing the King, whom <hi>Rumbold</hi> encouraged thereto, by telling them the conveniences of his Houſe for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, being a lone Houſe, and having a Court-Wall; uſing this as an Argument, <hi>That to kill the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:152694:147"/>King and the D. of</hi> York <hi>would be a keeping one of the Commandments, becauſe unleſs that were done, there would be a great deal of Blood-ſhed committed;</hi> telling them the way how they deſigned to effect it, as before; and if this way failed, then there ſhould be Men in the Habit of Countrey-men, with a Cart in the Lane, who ſhould run the Cart a-thwart the Lane, and ſo ſtop the Coach. —That at the <hi>Dolphin-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Bartholomew-Lane,</hi> where were <hi>Rumbold, Weſt, Goodenough,</hi> and <hi>Hone</hi> the Joyner; he heard <hi>Weſt</hi> talking to <hi>Rumbold</hi> about the King's returning from <hi>New-Market,</hi> asking him how many <hi>Swan-Quills, Gooſe-Quills,</hi> and <hi>Crow-Quills,</hi> with <hi>Sand</hi> and <hi>Ink</hi> he muſt have? To which was anſwered, 6 <hi>Swan-Quills,</hi> 20 <hi>Gooſe-Quills,</hi> and 20 or 30 <hi>Crows-Quills:</hi> ſaying that by <hi>Swan-Quills</hi> was meant Blunderbuſſes, by <hi>Gooſe-Quills</hi> Muskets, and by <hi>Crows-Quills</hi> Piſtols, and by <hi>Sand</hi> and <hi>Ink</hi> Powder and Bullets. —That he was at the <hi>Salutation-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet</hi> with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and others, the Thurſday before the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, where ſome of them call'd him <hi>Gulick</hi> (there being then a Report of one <hi>Gulick</hi> that headed a Riſing at <hi>Cologn</hi>) Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> telling him that <hi>Gulick</hi> in Dutch was <hi>Keeling</hi> in Engliſh; and that he hoped to ſee him at the Head of as good an Army in <hi>Wapping,</hi> as <hi>Gulick</hi> was at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logn;</hi> which was all he could ſay as to the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. —He gave them a further account, how <hi>Goodenough</hi> gave him 3 Papers of 3 Diviſions of the City, one for himſelf, and the other 2 for whom he could truſt; adviſing him to take 9 or 10 Men to his Aſſiſtance, who were to ask ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:152694:148"/>Perſons, Suppoſing that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould riſe, or be a <hi>French</hi> Invaſion, <hi>Are you in a Poſture of Defence?</hi> Which was all they were to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and by this means feel them, and ſee how many Men could be raiſed; telling him moreover of a Deſign to kill the King and the Duke at the <hi>Bull-Feaſt,</hi> and lay it upon the Papiſts as a Branch of the Popiſh Plot: and that one was drawing a Declaration to take away the Chimney-Money, that ſo the common People might fall in with them more readily. Saying, that it was trouble of Mind cauſed him to make this Diſcovery, which he did to one Mr. <hi>Peckham,</hi> who brought him to the Lord <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and thence to Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins:</hi> Acknowledging himſelf to be the Perſon who arreſted the Lord-Mayor; and that <hi>Goodenough</hi> did tell him, that the Deſign was to ſecure the Lord-Mayor, and the Sheriffs, and the Tower.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Zachary Bourne</hi> depos'd, That he came acquainted with the Priſoner by means of Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> who lodg'd at his Houſe; That he was at their Meeting at the <hi>Dragon</hi> upon <hi>Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> where the Priſoner was; and their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was about a Deſign of raiſing and dividing the City into 20 parts, in order to the ſecuring of his Majeſty and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> That he was at the Meeting alſo at the <hi>Salutation</hi> in <hi>Lumbard-ſtreet;</hi> and that the firſt meeting he had with them, was about ten days before the Diſcovery. That Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> ſpoke about ſecuring the Lord Keeper, for that he would call him to account for <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Death. That he would have ſpoke
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:152694:148"/>to two Nonconformiſt Miniſters concerning this Deſign, but Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> was unwilling, and ſaid, the Miniſters had deſtroyed all Deſigns ever ſince <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Time, and he would have nothing to do with them now. That he met alſo with them at Capt. <hi>Tracey</hi>'s on the Monday after the Diſcovery, where the Priſoner was, and there they diſcourſed about killing of <hi>Keeling;</hi> and rather than be hang'd, thought it better to ſtand to it with Swords in their Hands. That he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard indeed the Priſoner ſpeak any thing of aſſaſſinating the King, but that he had ſeveral times heard a diſcourſe of <hi>Lopping,</hi> (by which was meant taking off the King and the Duke) and ſuppoſed the Priſoner had been at the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it too, as being the Diſcourſe of ſeveral Meetings.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> depoſed, That one Mr <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks</hi> brought him and the Priſoner firſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; who in <hi>November</hi> laſt imparted a Secret to him of a Deſign, of an Inſurrection to be made within three Weeks or a Month, wherein the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was engaged, and had engaged him; ſaying, that he had an expectation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Colonel of Horſe, proffering the Witneſs a Command under him; which he declined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had not a Conſtitution to bear the Toils of War.—That the Priſoner then told him alſo of another Deſign the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had upon the King and Duke, as they came from <hi>New-Market</hi> in <hi>October</hi> laſt; but that he abhorr'd any ſuch ungenerous thing, and would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in it, but only in a general Inſurrection; asking to have borrow'd a Suit of Silk-Armour
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:152694:149"/>of the Witneſs, and employ'd him to procure him a ſtiff Tuck: farther telling him, that the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was preparing a Declaration to be publiſhed, in caſe of an Aſſaſſination or Inſurrection, asking the Witneſs to undertake to do one too; becauſe he would have ſeveral People draw it, to pick one good one out of all; ſhewing him ſome Collections which he ſaid he had made towards it: Which was a Collection of all the Paſſages in the three Reigns of King <hi>James, Charles</hi> I. and this King; which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Attempts to introduce Arbitrary Government and Popery;</hi> taxing them with ſome perſonal Vices, and that the Government was diſſolved, and they were free to ſettle another Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Acquainting him that Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> had the management and conduct of the Aſſaſſinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>October;</hi> and that he likewiſe was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Inſurrection, and was a great Man in it. Meeting therefore with <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe he told him, that there was but two ways for the People to preſerve themſelves from Bondage; and one was by a general Inſurrection; the other by killing the King and Duke, which he ſaid was the beſt way. Then going to a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern with him, where was Col. <hi>Rumſey</hi> and one <hi>Row,</hi> they appointed to meet at the Witneſs's Chamber, as a place of privacy and little obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Where when they met, Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> propoſed ſeveral ways of Aſſaſſinating the King and the Duke. One was, as the King and Duke had their private viſits in St. <hi>James</hi>'s; another was, as they went down the River, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning or ſinking their Barge; another was at
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:152694:149"/>the Play-Houſe, by forty or fifty Men placed in the Pit with hand-Blunderbuſſes, Piſtols and Swords, who when the Muſick ſtruck up between the Acts, ſhould fire upon the Box. But becauſe this was thought hazardous, they thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to do it as he came back thence, in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> under <hi>Bedford-Garden</hi> Wall. That Col. <hi>Rumſey</hi> alſo did ſay, He wondred that the Lords and great Men that were ſo fond of the King, did not raiſe a Purſe, and buy ſome Body an Office, who ſhould rail againſt the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the <hi>Whiggs,</hi> and by that means get himſelf an opportunity of acceſs to the King's Perſon. That Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> alſo told him, after the Deſign in <hi>October</hi> had miſcarried, that there was another Deſign of attaquing the King and the Duke at my Lord-Mayor's Feaſt, in the Hall, or in their return Home, in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-Yard, or at <hi>Ludgate:</hi> And that Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> told him the ſame thing; but the King not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there, the thing was wholly diſappointed. That after theſe Diſcourſes, Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Holland,</hi> being afraid becauſe of a Book that he had printed; and Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi> went with him. That there he ſtaid till they writ for him to come over; and then they had ſeveral meetings, and reſolved upon the Aſſaſſination at <hi>Rye-Houſe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rumbold</hi> undertaking to provide Men: And the providing of Mony and Arms was alſo diſcours'd on, and the manner of doing it propoſed; the Priſoner being to attaque the Guards, he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any other part therein. <hi>Rumbold</hi> propos'd a way to bring them off, when the thing ſhould
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:152694:150"/>be done, over the Meadows, and ſo by <hi>Hackney-Marſh;</hi> which the Priſoner did not like, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they ſhould retire within the Wall, and there keep till Night, being a place they could defend againſt any Force for a day's time. That as to the Deſign upon the King's coming from the Play-houſe, one Mr. <hi>Row</hi> told him he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd with one <hi>Gibbons,</hi> that was the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Servant about it, and ask'd him, if any of their Family knew of it? and he ſaid, They all knew of it, but would not be ſeen in it; and ſaid, that he ſhew'd him the place. That after the diſappointment at <hi>Rye-Houſe,</hi> they adjourned to his Chamber to conſider what they ſhould do. And a day or two after they met at the <hi>Dolphin</hi> Tavern, where Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> talking of Blunderbuſſes and Piſtols in down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Engliſh; he told him it was a fooliſh thing to talk ſo before Drawers, and that was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of calling them by the Names of <hi>Swan-Quills, Gooſe-Quills,</hi> and <hi>Crow-Quills.</hi> At the next Meeting (which was the next Week) at the <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Vulture,</hi> where was the Priſoner, Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> one <hi>Norton,</hi> and one <hi>Ayliff;</hi> They agreed to buy Arms, <hi>viz.</hi> 10 Blunderbuſſes, 22 Inches in the Barrel; 30 Carbines, 18 Inches; and 30 Caſes of Piſtols, 14 Inches; putting him upon the buying of them, becauſe he was ſerviceable no other way; and could have a Pretence for it, becauſe he had a Plantation in <hi>America;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> was to pay the Mony; which he did, after he had bought the Arms, with 93 Guinies, which as he ſuppoſed came from Mr. <hi>Charlton.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:152694:150"/>
               <p>That at the laſt meeting with Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> he heard him ſay, That there was a Man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſee what conveniency there would be for an Aſſaſſination between <hi>Windſor</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court;</hi> but that was never reported, and ſo laid aſide. That had the Aſſaſſination gone on, theſe things were to be done; The Lord-Mayor and Sheriffs were to be kill'd, and as many of the Lieutenancy as they could get: and <hi>Papillon</hi> and <hi>Dubois</hi> be forc'd to take the Office of Sheriff upon them, or elſe be uſed as the reſt. And Sir <hi>Thomas Gold,</hi> Sir <hi>John Shorter,</hi> or Alderman <hi>Corniſh</hi> (who was thought the fitteſt Perſon) be ſet up for Lord-Mayor. The Principal Miniſters of State alſo were to be kill'd, the Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> the Lord <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> (whom they ſaid they would hang upon the ſame poſt that <hi>Colledge</hi> was hang'd upon for his Murder); Sir <hi>John Moor</hi> was to be kill'd, and hung up in <hi>Guild-Hall;</hi> and the Judges to be flead and ſtuffed, and hung up in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi> And ſeveral of the <hi>Pentionary Parliament</hi> were to be hang'd up alſo. The King's Natural Sons they ſaid were good luſty Fellows, and would ſerve for Porters or Water-men; and the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> they would marry to ſome Country Gentleman for a Breed to keep out Foraign Pretences. And that the Priſoner at the Bar was, ſometimes at theſe Meetings, when theſe things were diſcourſed of, though not ſo often as the reſt. And after the News of the Fire, he ſaid he believed God ſhew'd his diſapprobation of the thing, deſiring to have his Name concealed; whereupon <hi>Ferguſon</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:152694:151"/>told him, he needed not to be aſhamed, for that it was a glorious Action, and ſuch an Action as he hoped to ſee publickly gratified by the Parliament; and queſtion'd not but they ſhould be fam'd for it, and have Statues erected for them, with the Title of <hi>Liberatores Patriae.</hi>— That he had told ſome Nonconformiſts, who deſired him to forbear; but, ſays he, they are ſilly People, that do not know how to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between killing a Prince for difference in Opinion about Religion, and deſtroying a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, for preſervation of the Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the People; ſaying, it was an Action that would make all the Princes of the World tremble, and teach them to uſe their Subjects kindly. That about <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> Col. <hi>Rumſey</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him of an Inſurrection deſign'd to be about <hi>March,</hi> carry'd on, by the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Ld. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Ld. <hi>Grey,</hi> Ld. <hi>Howard,</hi> Col. <hi>Sidney,</hi> Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hambden;</hi> to whom they drew up ſome things to be done for the People, but they were rejected in regard all was to be left to a Parliament.—That he was at the <hi>Salutation,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Nelthrop</hi> called Mr. <hi>Keeling, Culing.</hi>—That there was a Treaty with the <hi>Scot</hi>'s, but was broke off, as Mr. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon</hi> told him, becauſe they would not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare for a Common-Wealth.—That at the <hi>Young Devil-Tavern,</hi> he met with the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and others, where <hi>Holloway</hi> did propoſe, that ſince the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Buſineſs was broken off, they ſhould try what Forces could be rais'd here: and Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> did ſay, that if 3000 Men could be had, he believed the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:152694:151"/>and the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> would appear in the head of them. That a Map was brought, and the City divided into 20 parts; and each 20th part into 14ths and 15ths, and one principal Man was to have one 20th Part; and that <hi>Goodenough</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported afterwards that there were 1300 Men out of two of the Hamlets.—That Mr. <hi>Bourn</hi> told him he had ſpoken to one Parſon <hi>Lobb,</hi> who ſaid, he would try what his Congregation would do.—That about a fortnight before the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, <hi>Rumbold</hi> told him the jealouſy he had of <hi>Keeling,</hi> which if he could be ſatisfied of, that he deſign'd to betray them, he would get him into the Country and kill him; but upon the Saturday before the Diſcovery, <hi>Rumbold</hi> and one <hi>Gale,</hi> that was to be one of the Aſſaſſinates, lent <hi>Keeling</hi> 100 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> he being in need, and they unwilling to diſcourage him.</p>
               <p>On the Monday after the Diſcovery, they met in the Morning at Capt. <hi>Walcot</hi>'s Lodging, where it was agreed to go beyond Sea, only the Witneſs had no mind to go, and a Boat was hired, and 5. <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> given in earneſt; But under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Meſſengers were abroad, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the River was beſet, every Man ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for himſelf; and the Witneſs ſhifted by the means of Mr. <hi>Bourne</hi> who help'd him to a Conveniency for two or three days.—That being thus retired, they got Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> in the City, and <hi>Rumbold</hi> diſcours'd him in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſeveral Perſons, who denied that he had diſcovered, wiſhing a great many Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations upon himſelf. That after ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of killing him, they propos'd to him to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:152694:152"/>go out of Town, which he refuſed. That the ſame Night, upon tracing him, they found he had called out his Brother, and was gone to the Secretary's; whereupon it was took for granted that the Diſcovery was made, and that every Man muſt ſhift for himſelf. That upon that, Mr. <hi>VVade</hi> ſaid, That if the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would go into the Weſt, they might try a Puſh for it ſtill. And the Priſoner at the Bar ſaid, he was ſatisfied God would deliver the Nation, but that he did not approve of the preſent Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>Thus the ſum of what was faſtned on the Priſoner was, That he was at ſeveral Meetings, where the killing of the King and Duke was conſulted of; that he went down to <hi>Rumbold</hi>'s Houſe to view the Place, and undertook to fight the Guards.</p>
               <p>To this he pleaded, that he never was at <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold</hi>'s Houſe, but once, as he travell'd from <hi>York</hi> by <hi>Norwich,</hi> and ſo to <hi>London.</hi> And that he was not ſo natural a Fool to think, for him to charge the Guards, when another kills the King, but that he ſhould be as Guilty as he that kills. And that he was ill of the Gout all the while the King was at <hi>New-market.</hi> And for that Aſſaſſinating the King, it never entred into his thoughts more or leſs.</p>
               <p>But a Letter was then produc'd under his own hand to Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins,</hi> Secretary of State, purporting, <q>His trouble to ſee himſelf in his Majeſty's <hi>Proclamation,</hi> and his reſolution to lay himſelf at his Majeſty's Feet, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg his Crime, and diſcover all he knew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:152694:152"/>to <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which he ſuppoſed might be more than the Original Diſcoverer was able to acquaint his Majeſty with. And farther, That if his Majeſty thought fit, he would follow thoſe Lords and Gentlemen who were fled, and as ſoon as he could, would inform his Majeſty what Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they intended to take next. Otherwiſe he was reſolved to give his Majeſty no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble, but to lie at his Mercy, let him do with him what he pleaſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This letter Mr. <hi>Blathwait</hi> ſwore, Capt. <hi>VValcot</hi> owned for his, when he was examin'd before the King.—And Capt. <hi>Richardſon</hi> ſwore like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that yeſterday, his Clerk diſcover'd a piece of Paper in the Priſoner's Hand, which he deſigned to have given his Son; which was a Letter to Capt. <hi>Tracy,</hi> his Landlord, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to ſpeak to Col. <hi>Rumſey,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>VVeſt</hi> to ſpeak to her Husband to be tender of him, have ground enough to ſerve the King upon other Men; and the laſt words of the Note, were, <hi>If you cannot be Private, leave the Iſſue to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the whole the Priſoner pleaded, That the Witneſſes had made long Speeches, though very little of them relating to him, though too much. That he was ſent for out of <hi>Ireland</hi> (where his Habitation was, being a Man of a competent Eſtate) by the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> to go Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>Carolina;</hi> but it being ſome while before he came, his Lordſhip gave his Commiſſion to another. That being in <hi>England,</hi> the Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> invited him to go with him into <hi>Holland,</hi>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:152694:153"/>which he did; and upon his Lordſhip's Death he returned to <hi>London.</hi> That he confeſs'd it was his folly to frequent this Company; but it was plain that the Witneſſes had ſufficiently dipp'd themſelves, and therefore to ſave their own Lives, they had combin'd to take away his. That he did hear a deal of what they had now depoſed, but never had any hand in it, either directly or indirectly, and therefore ſuppoſed his Crime could be only <hi>Miſpriſion of Treaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Jury then deſiring he might be asked, What he had to ſay to the Letter? he replied, That what he had promiſed, he undertook up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his intimacy with Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> by whoſe means he believed he ſhould have an Intereſt with the reſt. That he did, according to his Promiſe, give an Account of what he had heard; but the King was not pleas'd with him, becauſe he did not deſcend to Particulars; which he could not do, he having never been at any of their Meetings or Debates, nor knew any thing but what he had by a private Hand.</p>
               <p>He then produced one Witneſs, who teſtified his being ill of the Gout for about three Months, but could not certainly tell the Time.</p>
               <p>After this Mr. Sol. Gen. having ſumm'd up the Evidence, the Ld. Ch. Juſtice gave his Charge to the Jury; who after about half a quarter of an hours conſideration, returned, and brought the Priſoner in <hi>Guilty.</hi>

Ch. Juſtice to tell him, that it was unuſual for Men in his Condition to uſe ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in ſuch a Caſe. And being afterwards told by Mr. Serj. <hi>Jefferies,</hi> that he found him not worthy of the Mercy the King had ſhewn him: Then Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> reply'd, That it was a Word put from him unawares.</p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>Nicholas Butler</hi> depoſed, That he had long known the Priſoner, and that he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready for plotting ſuch Purpoſes as were now laid to his Charge. For that when Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Chaplain</hi> was Lord-Mayor, and the King ſtood at Mr. <hi>Waldo</hi>'s the Priſoner came to his Houſe, and told him, that now they had a fair Opportunity to take off the King and the Duke at once: To which purpoſe there were to be half a dozen with Croſs-Bows, at a Window in <hi>Bow-Steeple,</hi> juſt oppoſite to the Balcony. That thereupon he acquainted the King and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> herewith, and one <hi>Horſel</hi> was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſearch and watch the Steeple, but none came; and that the Priſoner upon his Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation hereof before the King, had confeſſed all this.</p>
               <p>Capt. <hi>Richardſon</hi> depoſed, That he was by while Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> examin'd the Priſoner, as to the Crime he now ſtood charged with; and that he ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> came and told him he wanted <hi>Labourers;</hi> and that it was to kill the King and the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and confeſs'd, that he agreed to be one that would undertake it;
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:152694:155"/>and that <hi>Goodenough</hi> promis'd him 20 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> to bu him an Horſe and Arms. That at another Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſaid, he was for killing the King, and ſaving the Duke; but <hi>Goodenough</hi> was for both. That he told them the Buſineſs of <hi>Rye,</hi> which place he knew not; but ſaid, it was the place where the King was to be murdered.</p>
               <p>To all this the Priſoner ſaid little or nothing, only that he did not know the place where, nor when it was propoſed about the <hi>Rye;</hi> and that he was drawn into it by <hi>Goodenough.</hi> That as to the Croſs-Bows he was only told it, but never deſign'd it. And being ask'd what Religion he profeſſed? he anſwered, That he heard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Independents,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After a ſhort Charge, the Jury brought him in <hi>Guilty</hi> without ſtirring from the Bar.</p>

               <p>THen and there the Priſoner appearing, he was Arraigned upon an Indictment of High-Treaſon, for conſpiring the Death of the King, and ſubverſion of the Government: To which being required to plead, he deſired a Copy of his Indictment; but being told no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be granted till he had pleaded, he pleaded <hi>Not Guilty.</hi> And then complain'd of his being arraign'd and tried at the ſame time;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:152694:155"/>deſiring a Copy of his Panel, having had only ſome Names of Perſons uſually upon Juries; and that his Trial might be deferr'd till the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, in regard he had a Witneſs that was not in Town. But the Attorn. Gen. urg'd the Jury might be called. Then the Priſoner deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Pen and Ink, and ſome to write for him, and to have the uſe of his Papers; all which were granted.</p>
               <p>And then <hi>John Martin</hi> being named, the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> asked if he were a Free-holder of forty Shillings a Year; ſaying, that he thought none were allowed but ſuch as were Free-holders. To which the Court replied, That no Pannel was made in <hi>London</hi> by Free-holders, for that <hi>London</hi> Eſtates, belonging either to the Nobility or Gentry that lived out of the City, or to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, <hi>London</hi> was excepted.</p>
               <p>To this his Lordſhip urged the Statute of 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. wherein he ſaid it was poſitive, that in Caſes of Life and Death, no Man ſhould be judged but by thoſe that have forty Shillings a Year.</p>
               <p>But the Attorn.

               <p>And then Col. <hi>Rumſey</hi> being ſworn, depoſed, That about the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>November,</hi> the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſent him from his Lodging by <hi>VVapping</hi> to Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s, to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> there met, to know what Reſolution they were come to about the riſing of <hi>Taunton:</hi> Their anſwer was, That Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> had failed them, that he had promiſed 1000 foot and 300 Horſe, but when he came to perform it, he could not. He thought the People would not meddle, unleſs they had ſome time to make Proviſion for their Families. That Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> made this Anſwer, the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> being preſent, and the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> ſaying ſomething to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:152694:156"/>And upon this it was, the Lord <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> prepared to be gone. That he was with them at <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s about a quarter of an hour, and that there was ſome diſcourſe about ſeizing of the <hi>Guards</hi> at the <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mews,</hi> in caſe the Inſurrection had gone on, (which was to have been on <hi>Novemb.</hi> 19.) and that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Lord. <hi>Grey,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> undertook to view the Guards; and that the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> aſſented to all this; and the Witneſs was to have gone to <hi>Briſtol</hi> by the order of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> againſt that time.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> depoſed, that in <hi>October</hi> Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> came to him in the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s Name, to requeſt the conveniency of his Houſe, for him, and ſome other Perſons of Quality to meet; That in the Evening came the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> Col. <hi>Rumſey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> one after another. That Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> deſired they might be private, and therefore what they wanted, he fetch'd up himſelf, not ſuffering his Servants to come up. That their Diſcourſe was about ſeizing the Guards; and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> went one time to view them; and the next time they met at his Houſe, he heard Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ſay, the <hi>Guards</hi> were very remiſs in their Places, and not like Soldiers, and that the thing was feaſible if they had ſtrength to do it. That they met twice at his Houſe, and the Priſoner was there both times. That Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> read a Paper, in the Nature of a <hi>Declaration,</hi> ſetting forth the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:152694:157"/>Grievances of the Nation in order to a Riſing. He could not ſay the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was preſent at the reading of it; but Col. <hi>Rumſey</hi> was; who then deny'd it, ſaying, it was over before he came.</p>
               <p>Then the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> being ſworn, began his long Evidence with a low Voice (pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the News he had juſt then receiv'd of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Fate, had ſunk his Voice) and a long Story of the Deſigns of the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> an Account of which he had from Capt. <hi>VValcot,</hi> whom he brought acquainted with the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> and by whom the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſent for him, while he abſconded, at one <hi>VVatſon</hi>'s at the end of <hi>VVoodſtreet,</hi> and there diſcover'd to him his Deſign of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and that he had 10000 brisk Boys ready to follow him, whenever he held up his Finger, who were to poſſeſs themſelves of the Gates, and would in an Hour's time be 5 times multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. But that his Deſign was much retarded by the backwardneſs of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> who failed him in not being ready prepared to concur with him in the Country; that he then endeavour'd to ſhew the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> the neceſſity of having thoſe Lords concurrence in ſo weighty an Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and proffer'd his Service to bring them to a right Underſtanding among themſelves: to this end he ſpoke with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who deny'd that either he or the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had given the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> any incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ſo forward, becauſe they knew the Country could not be ready to ſtir ſo ſoon.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:152694:157"/>That a Meeting was then propos'd, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put off, by reaſon of the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s fears of being diſcover'd. That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> told him, that the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> had been with the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and preſwaded him to put off his <hi>Rendezvouz</hi> for only a Fortnight, againſt which time they would try to be ready for him. But the Country not being ready, that Deſign was diſappointed. That in <hi>October</hi> Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> acquainted him with the Deſign upon the King, with which he acquainted the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who ſaid he would never ſuffer it, and they did all they could to prevent it. This failing, the next Deſign was to be on <hi>Novemb.</hi> the 17th; but the Country not being then in a readineſs, the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> upon hearing it, went away for <hi>Holland.</hi> That after this they all began to lie under a ſenſe, that they had gone ſo far, and communicated it to ſo many, that it was unſafe to make a Retreat; And for the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on, thought it neceſſary there ſhould be ſome General Council, that ſhould take upon them the care of the whole: Whereupon they erected the Council of ſix, which conſiſted of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> jun. Col. <hi>Sidney,</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. That theſe met at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s Houſe about the middle of <hi>January</hi> laſt; and there the Particulars offer'd to their Conſideration, whereto they were to bring their Advice, were, Whether the Inſurrection were moſt proper to be begun in <hi>London,</hi> or in the Country, or both in an Inſtant? What Countries and Towns
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:152694:158"/>were fitteſt, and moſt diſpos'd to Action? What Arms were neceſſary to be got, and how to be diſpoſed? How to raiſe a Common Bank of 25 or 30000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> to anſwer all Occaſions? And laſtly, How to draw <hi>Scotland</hi> to conſent with them, it being thought neceſſary that all Diverſion ſhould be given.—That about ten Days after, the ſame Perſons met again at the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s; where it was reſolv'd to ſend into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to invite ſome Perſons hither, who could give the beſt accompt of the State thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>John Cockram,</hi> the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> and Sir <hi>Hugh Campbel;</hi> and that in Diſcourſe it was referr'd to Col. <hi>Sidney,</hi> to take care of that Buſineſs; who afterwards told him, he had ſent <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> and given him 60 Guinies for his Journey. That to avoid Obſervation, they concluded not to meet till the return of this Meſſenger; and he going in the mean time to his Eſtate in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and thence to the <hi>Bath,</hi> he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more; only when he came back he was informed <hi>Smith</hi> was come back, and Sir <hi>John Cockram</hi> with him. That he was ſure the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was preſent at theſe Meetings; and to his underſtanding did conſent, though nothing was put to the Vote; And he wiſhed he could ſay the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was not there. To this the Priſoner inſiſted, that moſt he had ſaid was only hearſay, and the two times they met, was not upon any formed Deſign, but to talk of News, and they were delighted to hear the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> talk, being full of Diſcourſe, of a voluble Tongue, and talk'd well. And that he never ſaw any of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen, only
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:152694:158"/>the Lord <hi>Melvil,</hi> but never upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>Here the Attorny General urged that <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> did go into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that <hi>Campbel</hi> he went for was taken; which Mr. <hi>Atterbury</hi> ſwore that he was then in his Cuſtody, and that he had been, by his own Confeſſion, four days in <hi>London</hi> before he was took.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> depoſed, That he never had any Converſation with the Priſoner, only he had heard Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> and Col. <hi>Rumſey</hi> ſay, that the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> in the Inſurrection in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> intended to take his Poſt in the Weſt, where Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> had failed them; and that they moſt depended upon him, becauſe he was looked upon as a Perſon of great Sobriety.— But this being all but Hear-ſay, the Court would not admit it as Evidence.</p>
               <p>The King's Counſel therefore left the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence here, and call'd on the Priſoner to make his Defence; who to all this made Anſwer, That he could not but think himſelf mighty unfortunate to ſtand there charg'd with ſo high a Crime, and that intermixed with the horrid Practices and Speeches of other People, the King's Counſel taking all Advantages, and improving and heightning things againſt him. That he was no Lawyer, an unready Speaker, and not ſo well prepared as he ſhould be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That he thought his Jury were Men of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and would conſider that the Witneſſes againſt him ſwore to ſave their own Lives. Neither was what Col. <hi>Rumſey</hi> ſwore enough to take away his Life; or if it were, the Time
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:152694:159"/>was elapſed by the 13th of this King, which limits Proſecution to ſix Months. Neither was a deſign of Levying War, Treaſon, unleſs it appeared by ſome <hi>Overt-Act,</hi> as appears by the 25th of <hi>Edw. 3d.</hi> And then deſiring to know upon what Statute he was indicted; it was told him, upon the 25th of <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he deſired Counſel upon theſe two Points, as Matter of Law; Whether the Treaſon were duly proved? and if it were, Whether it were puniſhable by the Statute?</p>
               <p>In Anſwer to which, the Court inform'd him, That if he were contented that the Fact ſhould be taken as proved againſt him, and deſired Counſel upon what was bare Matter of Law, he ſhould have it granted; but there could be no Matter of Law admitted, but upon a Fact admitted, and ſtated.—And whereas he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, that the Buſineſs at Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s Houſe was ſworn to only by one Witneſs; It was anſwered, that if there were one Witneſs of one Act of Treaſon, another of a <hi>2d,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a <hi>3d,</hi> that manifeſted the ſame Treaſon, it was ſufficient.—The Statute then of 25th of <hi>Edw. 3d.</hi> c. 2. was read.</p>
               <p>And then the Priſoner inſiſted that he was never but at one Meetings at Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s; and Col. <hi>Rumſey</hi> was there before he came in: but <hi>Rumſey</hi> ſaid, No, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> went away together.</p>
               <p>Then in behalf of the Priſoner, the Earl of <hi>Angleſey</hi> declared, That viſiting the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> laſt week, the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> came in, and told the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> that his Son could
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:152694:159"/>not be in ſuch a Plot, or ſuſpected of it; and that he knew nothing againſt the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> or any Body elſe, of ſuch a Barbarous Deſign. And then going on to tell what the Lady <hi>Chaworth</hi> had told him, the King's Counſel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted him, telling him, as the Court would not permit them to give Hear-ſay-Evidence againſt the Priſoner, ſo they muſt not permit his Lordſhip to do it for the Priſoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Edward Howard</hi> declared, That the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> took it upon his Honour and his Faith, he knew nothing of any Perſon concerned in that Buſineſs; and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> only thought the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> unjuſtly ſuffered, but he took God and Man to Witneſs, he thought the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> the Worthieſt Man in the World.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> declared, The Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was with him, the Night after the Plot broke out, and did then, as he had done before, with Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven proteſt, that he knew nothing of any Plot, nor believ'd any, and treated it with great Scorn and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> teſtified to the Prudence and Honour of the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely it was for him to be concern'd, and had heard him declare his ill Opinion of <hi>Rumſey,</hi> two or three Days after the Diſcovery, and therefore that it was unlikely he would entruſt him with ſuch a Secret.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Thomas Cox,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> again teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as to his Life and Converſation, and of his averſneſs to all Riſings; and that he ſaid the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was a Man of Luxureant Parts,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:152694:160"/>but he had the luck not to be truſted by any Party.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> Lord <hi>Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Levenſon Gore,</hi> Mr. <hi>Spencer,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Fitz-VVilliams</hi> ſpoke as to his Lordſhip's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
               <p>And then the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> being asked by the Jury what he ſaid to the Earl of <hi>Angleſey</hi>'s Evidence, owned what the Earl ſaid, but that he did it to out-face the Matter; and if he ſaid untrue, he ought not to be believed on his Oath; inſinuating, that he meant what he ſaid, to be meant of a Deſign of Murthering the King, which he did not not believe the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> or the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> guilty of: <hi>Carrying his knife cloſe</hi> (as he expreſs'd it) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Paring and the Apple.</hi>

               <p>To whom the Indictment being read, Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Jefferies</hi> opened the ſame; and then <hi>Thomas Leigh</hi> was ſworn; againſt whom the Priſoner excepted, becauſe he had been ſworn againſt as Guilty by two Perſons; and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Priſoner, he was afraid the Priſoner ſhould ſwear againſt him, and therefore come now to ſwear againſt the Priſoner firſt. But this was not allowed to be any Objection. Therefore Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> depoſed, that he had been concern'd in this Conſpiracy, and knew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, but that he believed Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> knew a great deal more; for that <hi>Goodenough</hi> and the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:152694:161"/>Priſoner engaged him in a Deſign of raiſing of Men; and <hi>Goodenough</hi> told him the Deſign was to ſet up the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and kill the King and the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and that Sir <hi>John Moor</hi> and the Aldermen were, to be kill'd, and their Houſes plundred; and that there would be Riches enough which would ſerve to maintain the Army. That Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> told him, he could provide Arms for 100 Men, and that nothing was to be done unleſs the King was ſeized; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we might remember ſince 41, when the King went and ſet up his Standard; therefore, ſaid he, we will ſeize them, that they ſhall not ſet up their Standard: But ſaid, he was not for ſhedding their Blood. That he ſaid alſo, it would be convenient to have a Golden Ball play'd upon <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> and to get ſome Sea-Captains to manage that Affair, and ſaid, he would engage Ten; and he that wins the Ball, take it. That every Captain ſhould then take his Party, and tell them they had other work; and then go with Long-Boats and Arms and ſeize the <hi>Tower.</hi> That he acquainted <hi>Goodenough</hi> with this; and telling him the Charge of the Ball, which the Priſoner had told him would be 10 or 12 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> he ſaid if it were 40 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> he would be at the Charge of it all. That after he heard he was ſworn againſt, Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> cut off his Hair, and procured him a Wig, and lodged hint at his Houſe. That he and <hi>Rouſe,</hi> and Mate <hi>Lee</hi> went ſeveral times to view the <hi>Tower.</hi> That <hi>Rouſe</hi> told him, he had ſpoke to two Sea-Captains, who were willing, but one was going to <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> and therefore the Work muſt be done
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:152694:161"/>before he went, or he could not aſſiſt. That while he lay hid at <hi>Rouſe</hi>'s Houſe, Mr. <hi>Nelthrop</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> directed him to deny all, when-ever he ſhould be taken into Cuſtody, and if could not touch his Life.—That they met ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times afterwards; and had an Account in <hi>June</hi> laſt, that Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> was in the <hi>North</hi> raiſing Men, and that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was thereabouts, and that a Deliverance ſhould be wrought for all this. That the Deſign was ſo laid, that he was told it was to be done in a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. That they never agreed on a Method to kill the King, but that they told him they had 1000 Horſe ready in the Country, and 500 Horſe ready in Town, and that the King ſhould be kill'd coming from <hi>Windſor.</hi> That they were contriving to ſend Arms by Night in Trunks to ſome private Place, where they were to arm themſelves in the Night; and ſome brisk Men were to go to <hi>VVindſor</hi> to know when the King came, and give Information; and ſo they were to ſet upon him in ſome convenient Place, and both the King and the Duke were to be taken off together: Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> ſaying, Take them off, and then no Man can have Commiſſion to fight for them. And both to him, and in Company, Mr. <hi>Rouſe</hi> (who had been a Traveller) had ſaid, That the King was ſworn, both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> to bring in Popery and Arbitrary Power in ſo many Years, and therefore it was no Sin to take him off; and told him, he had it under his own Hand.</p>
               <p>Then Mate <hi>Lee</hi> depoſed, That the Priſoner had ſeveral times treated with him to get Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:152694:162"/>fitting to make Commanders of Ships; ſome of the King's Men of War that lay at <hi>Dept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>VVoolwich,</hi> for that the <hi>Tower</hi> and <hi>VVhite-hall</hi> was to be ſecured, or elſe they could do nothing.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Corbin</hi> depoſed, That in 1681, he heard the Priſoner ſay, He thought the Seſſion of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament would be very ſhort: But thoſe frequent Prorogations and Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Parliament, would not avail the King; ſon that what ever he has, the Parliament gave him, and they may take it away when they pleaſe. Upon which one bidding him have a care what he ſaid; he reply'd, The King had forfeited his Crown, and had no more right to it than he had.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>VVilliam Richardſon</hi> depoſed, That when the Priſoner was firſt ſeiz'd, he denied his Name to be <hi>Rouſe,</hi> calling himſelf <hi>Johnſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Priſoner's Defence, was only a retorting the Accuſation upon the Witneſs, alledging, That Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> firſt diſcourſed theſe Treaſons to him, which he only liſtned to, to pump out the bottom of his Deſign, that he might diſcover them. Proteſting his Innocency, and that the words Mr. <hi>Corbin</hi> teſtified againſt him, was not ſpoke of the Parliament, but of the Pope, and he had been before tried and acquitted for them. Saying, it was his unhappineſs he had no Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to call.</p>
               <p>The Ld. Ch. Juſtice therefore, in a few words, ſumming up the Evidence, the Jury preſently brought him in <hi>Guilty.</hi>

               <p>To whom the Indictment being read, and briefly opened by Mr. <hi>North,</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Jeffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; Thomas Leigh</hi> depoſed, That the Priſoner in diſcourſe with him and <hi>Goodneough</hi> about ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the <hi>Tower,</hi> told them, that the only way was to do it with Mortar-Pieces, that he would venture his own Ship, and provide 200 Men; and lay his own Ship on <hi>Southwark</hi> ſide, and make up his 14 Guns he had already 24; and would undertake, once in 20 times, to diſmount the five Pieces that fac'd towards <hi>Southwark</hi>-ſide. That he ask'd <hi>Goodenough</hi> what Mony was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided? who anſwering, 40000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> He anſwered, the Seamen would ſwallow that up preſently;
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:152694:163"/>to which <hi>Goodenough</hi> replied, there was more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided at any time.</p>
               <p>Mate <hi>Lee</hi> ſwore, That the Priſoner told him, as they were in a Coach together, that one of theſe days they ſhould have a Ball to toſs; which afterwards he underſtood by <hi>Rouſe</hi> and <hi>Leigh,</hi> was the Ball that was to be toſs'd on <hi>Black-Heath.</hi> That about ſix Weeks ago, Capt. <hi>Blague</hi> and he walking about the <hi>Tower,</hi> and diſcourſing of ſeizing it; his way was to ſcale it; but the Captain ſaid, the beſt was to ſhoot Mortar-pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on <hi>Southwark</hi>-ſide; but about the Ship he could ſay nothing.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner's Defence was, That his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with <hi>Rouſe</hi> was, to procure him Mony, as being a Broker; which brought him ſometimes into <hi>Goodenough</hi>'s Company; but that he never diſcours'd about any Publick Affairs; and as to the ſeizing the <hi>Tower,</hi> it was only accidental Diſcourſe: And as for his 200 Men, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, his Veſſel being but a Pink, which had been in his Poſſeſſion but three Weeks; and what Arms he had, he bought therewith, and that he never heard any thing about, either a Ball or Bank of Mony. [Calling his Witneſſes.]</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>VVright</hi> declared, That he had waited on the Captain ever ſince he had been ſhipp'd; and was in his Pay before he had the Ship in poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Chappel,</hi> Carpenter, declar'd. The Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was not able to do any Service three Weeks ago; and that he had been ſhipp'd four Months and an half to go for <hi>New-York.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:152694:163"/>
               <p>One <hi>Bellinger</hi> the Chirurgeon declared, That he had belonged to the Ship ſeven Weeks, and to the Captain before he had a Ship; and for Guns belonging to the Ship, there were four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Saker-Guns, of which four were Wooden ones; ſix above Deck, and four in the Hold. —</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice then ſumm'd up the Evidence, taking notice to the Jury, that theſe Men belonged to the Captain a great while ago, and that there was only one Evidence that did affect him.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Jury Withdrawing, in a ſhort time returned, and brought him in <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE next day, being Saturday, <hi>July</hi> 14. 1683. the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Capt. <hi>VValcot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rouſe,</hi> and <hi>VVilliam Hone,</hi> were brought to the Bar to receive Sentence.</p>
               <p>Where the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> deſired to hear his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment read in Engliſh, which was granted; and thereupon demanded an Arreſt of Judgment, becauſe there had been no Evidence of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring the Death of the King, (as it was in the Indictment) but only of levying War.</p>
               <p>But the Verdict being paſt, the Court told him, they muſt go by what the Jury had found, and not the Evidence; and therefore Sentence was paſs'd upon him, to be <hi>Drawn, Hang'd,</hi> and <hi>Quarter'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Capt. <hi>VValcot</hi> had nothing to ſay, but deſired that his Son and ſome Friends might come and ſee him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hone</hi> had no more to ſay, but begg'd the ſame favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rouſe</hi> inſiſted on ſome Diſadvantages he had when he came on his Trial; and ſome difference between the Indictment, and their Oaths; but Verdict being paſt, Judgment was given againſt them three, as againſt the Lord <hi>Ruſſel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And upon Friday, <hi>July</hi> 20. following, <hi>VVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi> being drawn to <hi>Tyburn</hi> in one Hurdle, and <hi>Rouſe</hi> and <hi>Hone</hi> in another, and there put into a Cart, attended by Dr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> the Dean of <hi>Rippon,</hi> and the <hi>Ordinary</hi> of <hi>Newgate,</hi> who urged them much to diſcover all they knew of the Plot, after they had ſpoke to the People, were executed accordingly.</p>
               <p>The next day, being Saturday, <hi>July</hi> 21. the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> having taken leave of his Lady, the Lord <hi>Cavendiſh,</hi> and ſeveral others of his Friends, at <hi>Newgate,</hi> took Coach, with Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> who accompanied him to the <hi>Scaffold,</hi> built in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</hi> where he deliver'd his Speech to the Sheriff; and after ſome Preparation, he ordered the Executioner, after he had lain down a ſmall moment, to do his Office, without a Sign; and ſo his Head at three blows was ſevered from his Body, and ordered by the Sheriff to be delivered to his Lordſhip's Friends and Servants, as being given them by his Majeſty's Favour and Bounty.</p>

               <p>To whom the Indictment being read, Mr. <hi>Dolben</hi> opened the ſame, and the <hi>Attorney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> opened the Evidence; and then Mr. <hi>VVeſt</hi> was called, againſt whom the Priſoner excepted; becauſe he had heard, that he had confeſſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Treaſons, and deſired to know if he was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, alledging that otherwiſe he could not be a good Witneſs; but the Ld. Ch. Juſtice would not bear of it, he having been a Witneſs at the Ld. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Trial, and therefore being ſworn, he depoſed, That (as to the Plot in general) Capt. <hi>VValcot</hi> had told him in <hi>October</hi> laſt, the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> deſigned an Inſurrection in <hi>November,</hi> which he diſſwaded him from: and a little after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he told him the thing was diſappointed, and upon it <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> went into <hi>Holland:</hi> That Col. <hi>Rumſey</hi> about <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> told him, the D. of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> E. of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Ld. <hi>Howard,</hi> Ld. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> jun. and the Priſoner at the Bar, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Inſurrection; but afterwards he ſaid, they would not venture thereon, till they had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currency in <hi>Scotland:</hi> That Mr. <hi>Nelthrop</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards told him, that Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> had ſent <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> with Letters to
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:152694:165"/>invite ſome Scotiſh Gentlemen to Town, with Mony to bear his charges: The Letter bearing a Cant of ſettling Buſineſs in <hi>Carolina,</hi> but really was in order to the Inſurrection. That after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> returned, and ſome Scotiſh Gentlemen with him. And ſoon after Mr. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon</hi> ſaid the Scots propoſed, That if they might have 30000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> in ready Money, they would undertake to make an Inſurrection in <hi>Scotland,</hi> without the Concurrence of <hi>England;</hi> which Propoſal, he ſaid, was agreed to, and the Mony would be ſoon ready, and Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> would return it; That the Arms were ready bought, and the E. of <hi>Argile</hi> would go into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and head the Scots. That ſome difference aroſe about raiſing this Mony; but the Ld. <hi>Gray</hi> did offer to raiſe 10000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> out of his own Eſtate, if the reſt would pay their Proportion: That then the Scots came down to leſs, but were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with: That the places for riſing were <hi>Briſtol, Taunton, York, Cheſter, Exeter</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where it was to begin: That the Priſoner and Major <hi>VVildman</hi> were very inſtrumental in breaking off this Agreement, becauſe they could not agree about a Declaration, and about the form of Government; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> inclining to a Common-wealth; which the Scotiſh Nobility it was ſuppoſed would not agree to: That as to the Priſoner, he knew nothing in particular, and never ſpoke with him till ſince the Diſcovery.</p>
               <p>Then Colonel <hi>Rumſey</hi> being ſworn, depoſed, That about the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>November,</hi> he was ſent by the E. of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> to Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> s, to know of the Gentlemen
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:152694:166"/>met there (who were the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Ld. <hi>Gray,</hi> Ld. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Armſtrong,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi>) what was done about the Riſing intended at <hi>Taunton?</hi> who told him that Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> had failed them, and that it muſt ceaſe for that time. That afterwards he met ſeveral times in <hi>March, April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi>'s Chamber, and other places with Capt. <hi>VValcot,</hi> Mr. <hi>VVeſt,</hi> the two <hi>Goodenoughs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bourn</hi> and Mr. <hi>VVade,</hi> where they had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the City into twenty parts, of ſeven parts of which Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> brought an account, but ſaid nothing of the other thirteen, becauſe he had not ſpoken with thoſe who were to tell him how many Men they would afford for the Inſurrection. That a Council of ſix, (as Mr. <hi>VVeſt</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> told him) did manage the Riſing, which were the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> E. of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Ld. <hi>Howard,</hi> Ld. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hambden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> depoſed, That in Summer laſt, Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> brought him three Papers, one for himſelf, and the other two for whom he could truſt, in the two Diviſions; whom asking if he deſign'd a General Inſurrection? he reply'd that if he did not, if the King was taken off, this would do well, for then the People would know how to have recourſe to a formidable Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And he had heard him alſo ſay, that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> whom he knew not, had a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part in the Management of that Affair.</p>
               <p>Then the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> depoſed, That about the middle of <hi>January</hi> laſt, the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> and himſelf, being together
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:152694:166"/>(who he ſuppoſes were the firſt Movers hereof) did think it neceſſary to an Enterprize that had been long in hand, and fallen flat then, that it ſhould be revived by ſome ſelect Cabal (not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſeven) that ſhould be ſet up to give it Life, and govern its Motions. To this end the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> undertook to engage the E. of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the Ld. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> the E. of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hambden.</hi> Soon after he was told the Perſons named had agreed; and had appointed a meeting at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s Houſe that Month, where he met them, <hi>viz.</hi> the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> E. of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Ld. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Sidney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> and himſelf: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met, Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> opened the Seſſion, giving an account of the Reaſon, End and Intention of that Meeting: That afterwards they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the time of Riſing, and of Arms, and Mony to be provided, the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> propounding 25 or 30000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> but before any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſhould be made, a Coalition with <hi>Scotland</hi> was to be procured, and a fit Perſon thought on to be ſent thither. That about the middle of <hi>February</hi> following, they had another Meeting at the Ld. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Houſe; where it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> (diſcourſing of the Government they would terminate in) to have all reſolved into the Power of a Parliament; which, though ſounding harſh to ſome there, was conſented to, it being only a publick Good which all intended. Then was conſidered the ſetting a Correſpondency with the E. of <hi>Argile,</hi> the Ld. <hi>Melvin,</hi> Sir <hi>John Cockram,</hi> and the <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> propoſing <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> to be
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:152694:167"/>ſent, taking the care hereof upon himſelf; whom afterwards he ſent, and he ſaw about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Guinies which the Priſoner told him were for <hi>Smith;</hi> and afterwards told him, that he had heard from him, from <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> after this he going into the Country, heard nothing further.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Andrew Foſter</hi> then depos'd, as to his ſeeing Sir <hi>John Cockram,</hi> Commiſſary <hi>Monro,</hi> and the <hi>Campbells</hi> in Town at the beginning of Summer, coming up under a pretence of making a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe in <hi>Carolina;</hi> but that after the Rumor of the Plot, <hi>Cockram</hi> abſconded, and the <hi>Campbells</hi> (Father and Son) he heard were ſeiz'd, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Lodgings.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Atterbury</hi> depoſed, that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>July</hi> laſt he was ſent for into <hi>London,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a diſcovery of ſome <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen that lay bout <hi>Black-Fryers;</hi> and when he came, the Common <hi>Serjeant</hi> had been before him, and found Sir <hi>Hugh Campbel,</hi> and Sit <hi>John Cockram,</hi> who had been ſome little time in Town, making an eſcape into a Boat.</p>
               <p>After this Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd,</hi> ſwore his ſeizing of Papers in Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Houſe, the latter end of <hi>June</hi> laſt, the Colonel being preſent; and that he believed thoſe Papers ſhewn him now in the Court to be the ſame.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> ſwore, that he was acquainted with his Hand, and that he believed the Writing ſhewn him was his Hand; for that he had ſeen him write the Indorſment upon ſeveral Bills of Exchange.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> ſwore it to be like what came to him for his Hand-writing, though he had never ſeen
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:152694:167"/>him write but once; but had ſeen his Indorſment on Bills.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> ſwore he had never ſeen him write, but it was like his Indorſment on Bills, which he hath paid, and was never called to an account for Miſpayment.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Attorney General</hi> directed the Clerk what part of the Libel he ſhould read; which accordingly he did; and among the reſt, theſe particular Paſſages which were laid in his Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>The Power originally in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> is delegated unto the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, He (meaning the King) is ſubject unto the Law of God as a Man, to the People that makes him King, in as much as he is a King. The Law ſets a meaſure to that Subjection, and the Parliament judges of the particular caſes thereupon ariſing. He muſt be content to ſubmit his Intereſt unto theirs, ſince he is no more than any one of them in any other reſpect, than that he is by the common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all raiſed above any other. If he doth not like this condition, he muſt renounce the Crown; but if he receive it upon that condition (as all Magiſtrates do the Power they receive) and ſwear to perform it, he muſt expect that the Performance will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, or revenge taken by thoſe that he hath betrayed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And elſewhere was read theſe Sentence, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>We may therefore change or take away Kings, without breaking any Yoke; or, that is made a Yoke which ought not to be one; the Injury therefore is in making or impoſing, and there
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:152694:168"/>can be none in breaking it. Alſo, that the general Revolt of a Nation from its own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates could not be call'd a Rebellion. And that the Power of calling and diſſolving Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments is not in the King.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Much more was read, on the ſame Argument, and then the Sheets were ſhewn to the Priſoner, who ſaid he knew not what to make of it, and let him give an account of it that did it. After which the Record of the Conviction of the Ld. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was read; the King's Counſel here ending their Evidence.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner then beginning his Defence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know upon what Statute he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted; and being informed it was upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 25 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. upon the firſt Branch, for conſpiring the Death of the King; he argued that the finding of ſuch a Pager in his Houſe, could not therefore concern him. For though Sir <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> did ask him to put his Seal to it, yet not till he had been in his Cloſet, and he knew not what he had put into the Bag, and therefore he refuſed to ſeal it. And for his Hand, it was eaſy to be counterfeited. And for the Witneſſes, that he never ſpake with the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> above three times in his Life; and that therefore the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi>'s Teſtimony was very improbable. That however there was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he that witneſſed againſt him; whereas there ought to be two to the ſame thing. That the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> had ſaid at the Ld. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Trial, that he ſaid all he could, but that now he had ſaid many things he did not then mention; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly what concerned Mr. <hi>Hambden;</hi> that
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:152694:168"/>he was under the Terror of Puniſhment for Treaſon whereof he had accuſed himſelf; and had ſaid that he could not get his Pardon, until he had done ſome other Jobs, and till he was paſt this Drudgery of Swearing; beſides that he owed him a conſiderable Sum of Mony, and had proteſted the Priſoner's Innocence. — That the Paper ſeemed to be written long ſince, and in anſwer to Sir <hi>Robert Filmers</hi> Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Urging that conſpiring to levy War is no Treaſon, and deſired Counſel upon it (but the Court would not hearken) He urged alſo that no Man ought to be anſwerable for what he writes in his own Cloſet, unleſs he publiſh it.</p>
               <p>After which he called the E. of <hi>Angleſy,</hi> who declared that being in company with the E. of <hi>Bedford,</hi> when the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> came to give him a viſit, and to comfort him in his Affliction for his Sons being taken, he told him he was not to be troubled, for that he had a diſcreet, a wiſe, and a vertuous Son, and that he could not be in any ſuch Plot, and his Lordſhip might therefore well believe his Son ſecure; for he believ'd he was neither guilty, nor ſo much as to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. He proceeded further, and ſaid he knew of no ſuch barbarous deſign; and could not charge the Ld. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> with it, nor any body elſe.</p>
               <p>The E. of <hi>Clare</hi> declared, that the Ld. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> about a Week before he was taken, did ſay, ſpeaking of the Times, that if ever he was queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd again, he would never plead, becauſe he was ſure they would have his Life, though never ſo innocent; ſaying, he thought the Perſecution
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:152694:169"/>was begun which Bp. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> had propheſied of, but he hoped it would be ſhort. And for Col. <hi>Sidney,</hi> he did with great Aſſeverations aſſert that he was as innocent as any Man breathing, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much in his praiſe, and bemoaning his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; which he thought real, becauſe never Man was ingaged more to another, than he was to Col. <hi>Sidney;</hi> And ſpeaking of Papers, he ſaid he was ſure, they could make nothing of any Papers of his.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Philip Howard</hi> declared, that when the Plot firſt broke out, he met the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> at his Brothers houſe, and telling him of it, and naming the Perſons to him, who had confeſs'd it, he ſaid he knew none of them, and it amazed him, thinking ſuch a thing not poſſible. That adviſing him then to procure an Addreſs from the diſcontented Lords, to ſhew their Deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing, as a means to reconcile all things, he promis'd him to go about it, deſiring him to ſtay till he came back; but that he never came back while he was there. The next day, he found him again at his Brother's houſe, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him of the Ld. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s being taken, he ſaid, <hi>VVe are then all undone,</hi> deſiring him to go to the Ld. <hi>Privy Seal</hi> to ſee whether he was to be taken up: for that he doubted it was a Sham-Plot: for if it were a true Plot, he ſhould fear nothing; but being a Plot made upon them, no Man was free. That he met him a third day at the ſame Place, and found him very melancholy, becauſe (as he ſaid) Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> was taken; he having that particular Obligation from the Colonel that no one Man had from another.</p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:152694:169"/>
               <p>Then Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> declared, that the Ld. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> came to him, the day after the Plot broke out, and with Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven, he proteſted he knew nothing of any Plot, and believed nothing of it, and ſaid, that he looked upon it was a ridiculous thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſeph Ducas</hi> (a French Man) declared, that the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> came the day after Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> was took, to the Priſoner's houſe, adviſing the carrying all the things out of his houſe where they might be ſafe. And another time coming again, he ſaid he knew nothing of this Plot, and he was ſure had Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> known any thing, he would have told him. And that he then telling my Lord, he was not ſafe in his Houſe; the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> ſaid he had been a Priſoner, and he had rather do any thing in the World than be a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner again.</p>
               <p>Then the Ld. <hi>Paget</hi> declared, that ſeeing the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> preſently after the breaking out of this Plot, he told him he was glad to ſee him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and that he was not concern'd in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. Which he ſaid, he took as an injury to him, for that his ſaying ſo looked as if he were guilty; but that he knew nothing of himſelf, or any Body elſe; nor had he ſeen any Body that could ſay any thing of him, or give him any occaſion to ſay any thing of any Body elſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Edward Howard</hi> declared, That as ſoon as the Plot broke out, the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> having a great intimacy with him, he expreſſed a great deteſtation, and ſurprizing in himſelf to hear of it; and aſſured great Aſſeverations, that he could neither accuſe himſelf, nor any
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:152694:170"/>Man living; and that he was much concern'd for certain Perſons of Quality, that they ſhould be ſo much reflected on, or troubled about it. And that this he verily, thinks my Lord ſpoke ſincerely; and that he knew his Diſpoſition ſo well, that if he had had any Guilt upon him, be would never have ſtood his being taken. —That another time, diſcourſing the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> about this Plot (which he omitted at the Ld. <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Trial, by reaſon of the reproof accidentally given him) that it was certainly a <hi>Sham,</hi> even to his Knowledg, too black for any Miniſter of of publick Employment to have devis'd, but that it was forged by People in the dark, ſuch as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits and Papiſts, and that this was his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And that he conſented to Addreſs the King under his Hand to teſtify his abhorrency of the thing; but upon the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s being taken, this was laid aſide. That he really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved what my Lord ſaid then was true; and were he of this Jury, he would not believe what he ſaid now. For ſaying which, the Court told him, he ought to be bound to his good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner then urged the Mortgage, which the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> acknowledged.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> then declared, that about 6 Weeks ſince, the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> ſent for him to come and ſee him; and talking then of his Pardon, he ſaid he had a Warrant for it, and their Word and Honour for it, but that he would do nothing in it till he had further order; and that he heard nothing of it, and could aſcribe it to no other Reaſon, but that he muſt not have his Pardon
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:152694:170"/>till the drudgery of Swearing was over.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner then called Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs,</hi> to prove that the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> ſaid he could not have his Pardon till he had done ſome other Jobs, but they did not appear.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Grace Tracy</hi> declared, that the Ld. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> proteſted his Ignorance of the Plot, and of Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi>'s being concern'd in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elizabeth Penwick</hi> declared to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and that he deſired withal that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel's Plate might be ſent to his Houſe for Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for that he was apprehended through Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</p>
               <p>Then one Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> ſtood up, and offer'd to the Court, that if the ſheets might be ſhewn him, he would undertake to imitate them in a little time, that they ſhould not know which was which. It being the eaſieſt Hand that ever he ſaw in his Life.</p>
               <p>Then the Priſoner proceeding in his Defence, urg'd the Statute upon which he was Indicted, as conſiſting of 2 Branches, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in his Indictment together, though they were diſtinct ſpecies of Treaſon. And that the buſineſs of <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was only conjecturally and implicitly ſworn. And the Papers were imperfect, and had been writ many Years, and never publiſh'd, and could have no concatenati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>Select Council,</hi> which the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> had ſworn, though ſelected by no Body; urging how unlikely it was for a War to be rais'd by 6 Men, not knowing nor truſting one another; the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> putting ſuch things upon them, as were impoſſible for any one to do, that had but
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:152694:171"/>the ſenſe of Porters and Grooms.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Solicitor General</hi> then ſumm'd up the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; making the Ld. <hi>Howard,</hi> and his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, two very good Witneſſes againſt him.</p>
               <p>Then the Ld. <hi>Ch. Juſtice</hi> declared his Charge to the Jury, who withdrew for half an hour, and then brought the Priſoner in <hi>Guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And upon Monday, <hi>November</hi> the 26th, being ſet to the Bar, the Priſoner pleaded that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived he had had no Tryal, for that ſome of the Jury were no <hi>Free-holders,</hi> and were not ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd by the <hi>Bailiff,</hi> but were agreed upon by the Under-<hi>Sheriff</hi> and others; deſiring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment might be read again, (which was done) and then he urged it was void, becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd the King of his Title of <hi>Defenſor Fidei,</hi> which was Treaſon by the Law. Urging that there was no Treaſon in his Papers; and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> might be ſent for, to teſtify if there were any ſuch thing as a Deſign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> complaining that his Evidence had not been rightly ſumm'd up; and appealing to God and the World; he not being heard.—After which the Ld. <hi>Ch. Juſtice</hi> pronounced Sentence upon him, to be <hi>Drawn, Hang'd, and Quartered,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> cry'd out; <q>Then, O God, O God, I beſeech thee, Sanctify theſe Sufferings unto me, and impute not my Blood to the Country, nor the City, through which I am to be Drawn; let no inquiſition be made for it: but if any, and the Shedding of Blood that is Innocent, muſt be revenged, let the weight of it fall only upon thoſe, that malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Perſecute me for Righteouſneſs ſake.</q>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:152694:171"/>—Whereupon the Ld. <hi>Ch. Juſtice</hi> told him, he pray'd God fit him for another World, for he ſaw he was not fit for this. But the Priſoner holding out his Hand, bid his Lordſhip feel his Pulſe, and fee if he was diſordered; bleſſing God, he never was in better temper than he was now.</p>
               <p>On Friday, <hi>December</hi> the 7th, following (his Sentence being mitigated by his Majeſty's Grace and Favour) he was brought from the <hi>Tower,</hi> to a Scaffold on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> where after a ſhort Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, he was beheaded by the Common Executioner.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>VVilliam</hi> Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> was ſworn, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, how the Ld. <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had communicated to him his deſign of an Inſurrection in the City, and employ'd him ſeveral times with Meſſages to the D. of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> but was diſappointed by the unreadineſs of the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and Ld. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> to joyn with him, and thereupon he took himſelf into <hi>Holland,</hi> where he dyed ſoon after. Upon which, afterwards, was conſtituted this Council of Six, of which the Defendant was one, (he relating the Manner how, much after the

               <p>After which Mr. <hi>Sheriff,</hi> who kept the <hi>Black-Spread Eagle</hi> in <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> being ſworn, corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi>'s teſtimony, by depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> (who then went by the name of <hi>Clerk,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Atterbury</hi> depoſed that he knew, as ſoon as he was brought where <hi>Smith</hi> was) lodged at his Houſe about the middle of <hi>February</hi> laſt, and there hired a Guide for him, to ſhew him the neareſt Road into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to <hi>Douglas;</hi> and that he left his own Man at his Houſe till he came again, which was about 12 days, and then he came <hi>Southward.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>Andrew Foſter</hi> depoſed, that he ſaw Sir <hi>John Cockram,</hi> Mr. <hi>Monro,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Campbel</hi> the Son, in Town, the beginning of laſt Summer.</p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Atterbury</hi> ſwore, that Sir <hi>Hugh Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> Sir <hi>George Campbel, Bayley,</hi> and ſome others
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:152694:173"/>were taken in <hi>Black-Fryars,</hi> the beginning of <hi>July</hi> laſt; and that he took the reſt in a cunning hole in <hi>Moor-Fields,</hi> who were afterwards ſent Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Counſel for the King here ceaſing their Evidence, Mr. <hi>VVilliams</hi> ſpoke in behalf of the Defendant, and obſerved firſt of all, That whereas the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> was very poſitive and particular as to ſome things, yet in what moſt affected the Defendant, and wherein it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to contradict or diſprove him, he was wanting as to that Circumſtance of Time of their Meetings. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he had not made uſe of any one Circumſtance of Fact in the Caſe of the Defendant, ſave only that of <hi>Aaron Smith.</hi> That it appeared (by his intimacy with the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s deſign) that he was deeply guilty of Treaſon himſelf; and being there was a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery made before him by others, it concerned the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> to give an home-Evidence, and perhaps to ſtrain, that he might merit his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and by expoſing this Gentleman, and the Blood of others, ſecure himſelf ſafe.—And alſo, that he appeared not much to be credited, from his own ſo often, and ſo ſolemn denials of his knowledg of any thing of this Nature; And from his having ſaid lately that the Ld. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> died innocent, and that Col. <hi>Sidney</hi> had hard Meaſure; And from his ſaying he could not have a Pardon, till the Drudgery of Swearing was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; And diſcourſing with one about the Souls Immortality, and a future State, his ſaying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to his Friend, <hi>How long wilt thou perſiſt in this folly? How long wilt thou be ſo fooliſhly prevail'd
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:152694:173"/>upon, as to believe the VVorld was ever made, or will ever have an end?</hi> Theſe things, that they had witneſſes to prove. And that as to <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> it was not proved that the Defendant was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd with him, or with thoſe <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that came to Town; nor was it proved that <hi>Smith</hi> was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but only within 6 Miles; And that Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> could be proved to be a Man of a ſober, retired and ſtudious Diſpoſition; and much in <hi>France,</hi> and deſigned again for <hi>France,</hi> and not likely therefore to be engaged in ſuch Deſigns of importance. —Proceeding then to call Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>And firſt Mr. <hi>Ducas</hi> (the French Man) gave the ſame Account of what the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> had ſaid of his Ignorance of the Plot, at Col. <hi>Sidneys</hi> Houſe, as he had done at Col. <hi>Sidneys</hi> Trial.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Philip Howard</hi> did the like, of what he heard him ſay, at his Brother's Houſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had depos'd. Mr. <hi>Edward Howard</hi> was called, but did not appear.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Clare</hi> next gave in his Evidence, upon Oath, as before.</p>
               <p>As likewiſe did the Ld. <hi>Paget.</hi> And after him Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> gave an Account of what Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had made him, of his knowing nothing of the Plot; diſcourſing an hour to diſpoſſeſs the Doctor of the belief of any ſuch thing. The Doctor being asked his belief now, ſaid he made no doubt of the Aſſaſſination.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Gisborne</hi> then depoſed, that he heard the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> ſay, the <hi>Saturday</hi> before he was took into Cuſtody, that he knew nothing of the Plot.</p>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:152694:174"/>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> then gave in his Evidence, of what the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> ſaid of the drudgery of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Then Witneſſes were called to prove Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> a Perſon very unlikely to be engaged in ſuch a Plot, as being a wiſe, vertuous, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſtudious Man, and not at all of a turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, factious, ſeditious Spirit, as the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment charg'd him to be; but mild, and peaceable, never expreſſing any diſcontent about the Male-adminiſtration of the Government: To which purpoſe ſwore the Ld. <hi>Paget,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pelham,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Hobart</hi> who had known him in <hi>France;</hi> and of his intentions to return into <hi>France</hi> with the Ld. <hi>Mountague</hi> about <hi>March</hi> laſt, for his health; he coming thence but the <hi>September</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. To which Monſieur <hi>Juſtell</hi> (a French Man, who ſpoke by an Interpreter) depoſed; as alſo Dr. <hi>Lupee,</hi> another French-Man, who had lived with Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> two Years.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>VVilliams</hi> offered Dr. <hi>Needham</hi>'s Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to declare what Opinion the E. of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had of the Ld. <hi>Howard;</hi> whence he would infer the unlikelihood of ever his meeting to conſult with him. But this the Ld. Ch. <hi>Juſtice</hi> would not admit of, though Dr. <hi>Needham</hi> was ſworn; ſaying, <hi>It ſeems my Ld. of</hi> Eſſex <hi>had ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Ld.</hi> Howard's <hi>Evidence, That he thought fit to cut his own Throat rather than abide the Trial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Murray</hi> was ſworn, to depoſe the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi>'s Opinion of the World to come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd; which put the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> into a violent Paſſion; and was ſo preſſing upon his
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:152694:174"/>Reputation, that the Evidence was waved.— After which Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> would have ſpoke, and Mr. <hi>VVallop</hi> but Mr. <hi>VVilliams</hi> would have their Evidence left here.</p>
               <p>The Ld. <hi>Ch. Juſtice</hi> therefore ſumm'd up the Evidence; anſwering the Objections of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant's Counſel; and directing the <hi>Jury</hi> to bring the Defendant in <hi>Guilty,</hi> upon the Ld. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> teſtimony thus ſupported by 4 Witneſſes, unleſs they thought him guilty of wilful and corrupt Perjury. The <hi>Jury</hi> therefore withdrew for half an Hour, and then brought in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant <hi>Guilty</hi> of the Treſpaſs and Miſdemeanour whereof he was Indicted.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> following, <hi>Febr.</hi> 12th, 1683, the <hi>Attorn. Gen.</hi> mov'd for Judgment upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; upon which Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> being ordered to come into Court, the Judgment of the Court was, that a Fine of 40000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> ſhould be ſet upon him; That he ſhould be committed till he paid it; and find Sureties for his good behaviour during Life.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>VVilliams</hi> prayed his <hi>Bail</hi> might be Diſcharg'd, which was agreed, he being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. And for the High-Treaſon it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that he was diſcharged by the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act, there being no Proſecution.—Then Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> was carried away Priſoner by the Marſhal.</p>

               <p>After which Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> being ſworn, depoſed, That Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> that very Morning the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was kill'd, told him, on the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> Key, about 11 a Clock, ſeveral Perſons ſtanding together, that he was informed from Home, that his Boy had told his Wife, that he being in the <hi>Tower,</hi> ſaw a Hand throw a Razor out of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Window.—That on the Monday after his Brother Mr. <hi>Hatſell,</hi> came down along with Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> to his Houſe at <hi>Wanſtead</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and ſhewed him the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Inqueſt: Which having read, he told them what Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> had before told him of his Son; ſaying, it ſeemed to contradict that Paper, which ſays the Razor was found lying by the Earl's Body.—That afterwards, <hi>July</hi> 17. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> came to him to <hi>Smith</hi>'s Coffee-houſe; and Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> told him, that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had then been at his Houſe to examine his Son about ſeeing the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor. Whereupon he told them, that he had read the Coroner's Inqueſt in print, and it was otherwiſe declared there, and therefore deſired there might be no diſcourſe of any ſuch thing, for he did not believe it; deſiring Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> to forbear medling in any ſuch thing, Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> being a poor Man, and having divers Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, might be ruined, and he might ruin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:152694:176"/>by himſelf too. [The Ld. Ch. Juſtice's endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to baffle this Witneſs, by making him repeat his Evidence ſo often, and dodging him with Queſtions, and wilfully miſunderſtanding him, deſerves a remembrance.]</p>
               <p>Next him Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> was ſworn, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, That <hi>July</hi> 13. 1683. his two Sons going to <hi>Merchant-Taylors</hi> School together in the Morning as they uſed to do, and by the way hearing the King was in the <hi>Tower,</hi> the younger of them, <hi>VVilliam Edwards,</hi> about thirteen Years old, gave his elder Brother the ſlip, and went into the <hi>Tower,</hi> and there rambled till about 10 a Clock; when he came home, and told one of his Siſters that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat, and that he ſaw an Hand throw a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor out of the Window; and a Maid, or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, came out of the Houſe, in a white Hood and ſtuff Coat, and took it up and went in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and then he heard a noiſe as of Murder cried out.—That he being at the Cuſtom-Houſe, and hearing of the News of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Death, his Houſe being near, he ſtepped Home about 10 in the Morning, and then his Family informed him of what the Boy had ſaid; and at Dinner he examin'd the Boy, and found he agreed with the Report of his Family, and confirmed it.—That he did not ſpeak of what his Son had reported till he had been at Home; (which the Court would have made a mighty Contradiction of, becauſe Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> depoſed that he was ſo informed <hi>from Home;</hi> as if ſome one had brought him the Report from Home, and not he himſelf been at Home for it; and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:152694:176"/>for which the Ld. Ch. Juſtice ſhamefully up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided and ſlandered him, notwithſtanding he very pertinently anſwered him, that he had not lived theſe 39 Years at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> without Honeſty.) That he never knew nor ſaw Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> before <hi>July</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> his Son being called, he charged him to ſpeak the Truth; whereupon the Ld. Ch. Juſtice bid the Boy turn about, and ſay, Father, be ſure you ſay nothing but the Truth.—Being ſworn, the Boy depoſed, That Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> took his Information in his Father's Parlour, writing down what he told him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what he had ſeen; that he took his Brother into the <hi>Tower,</hi> and ſhewed him the Place where he ſaid he had ſeen the Razor thrown out of the Window. That after the Writing was finiſhed, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> read it to him, and he own'd it all for Truth; but refuſed at firſt to ſign it becauſe he ſaid it was falſe, and he fear'd ſome Danger in it; Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would have had his Aunt to have ſigned it; but he telling him there was no harm in it, he ſigned it. And the Information being ſhewn him, he owned that was the Paper, and his Hand; but ſwore it was falſe, and that he ſaw no Razor.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Ld. Ch. Juſtice cried out; <q>What a Duſt has ſuch a trivial Report made in the World! Admit that the Boy had ſaid any ſuch thing: What an Age do we live in, that the Report of every Child ſhould blow us up after this rate! It would make a Body tremble to think what a ſort of People we live
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:152694:177"/>among: To what an Heat does Zeal tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſome People, beyond all Reaſon and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety? If ſuch a little Boy had ſaid ſo, 'twas not an half-penny matter; but preſently all the Government is to be Libell'd for a Boy; which whether he ſpeak true or falſe is of no great weight; and he ſwears 'tis all falſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Thomas Hawkins</hi> (the Son of Dr. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> of the <hi>Tower</hi>) being ſworn, depoſed, That he ſaw <hi>VVilliam Edwards</hi> in the <hi>Tower, July</hi> 13. and went with him round the <hi>Tower,</hi> looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King while he was walking; who going into the Conſtable's Houſe, they went with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Boys to play, and afterwards he went Home; and then ſoon after the Rumour of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Death coming, he with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtood before the Window, and <hi>Edwards</hi> came to him, and there they ſtood looking up for an hour or two at the leaſt, and then they went out of the <hi>Tower</hi> together; and that he was ſure there was no ſuch thing as a Razor thrown out of the Window.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Attorn. General ſaid to the Ld. Ch. Juſtice, That his Lordſhip ſaw what a fine Caſe this was, and how all this Noiſe and Buſtle has come to be made in the World. That the Rumor firſt did ariſe in a Fanatick Family, and was propagated by that Party. Ay (ſaid Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>) 'tis eaſily known whence it came.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Blathwait</hi> was then ſworn, who informed the Court, That on <hi>July</hi> the 20th, Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> brought this <hi>Edwards</hi> to <hi>White-hall,</hi> where the Boy denied, before the King, that the Matter contained in the Information was true; and
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:152694:177"/>ſaid, it was only a Lie he invented to excuſe himſelf for having play'd Truant that day. After this that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> did nevertheleſs purſue this Buſineſs.—He atteſted alſo Mr. <hi>Speke</hi>'s Letter, and that he owned before the King and Council.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Mon-Stevens</hi> depoſed, That about five or ſix days after the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf, he ſaw Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> with a young Man and a Boy, at the Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi>'s Lodgings; and that he told him he came from Sir <hi>Henry Capel</hi> (who not being well could not come himſelf) with an Information relating to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Death. The Information he gave him to read, and then went with him to the Lord <hi>Sunderland,</hi> who took the Information; and afterwards Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was committed in Cuſtody, and the thing was brought before the Lords of the Council.</p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>Henry Capel</hi> was called, to know if he employed Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> in this Buſineſs; who depoſed, That he knew very little of Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but that he had been with him twice; and ſpeaking to him of this Buſineſs, he deſired him to acquaint the Secretary of State with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had to ſay of it, to which he ſeemed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willing.</p>
               <p>Then one Mr. <hi>Beech</hi> depoſed, That he was preſent when Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> was apprehended in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and ſeveral Papers found upon him, (Copies whereof he deliver'd into the Court) and upon Examination committed to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Goal, and from thence removed by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> hither up to <hi>London;</hi> That he then told
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:152694:178"/>them his Buſineſs was to enquire after the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Murder; and that one Mr. <hi>Burgis</hi> of <hi>Marleborough</hi> had writ him a Letter, that one <hi>Compton,</hi> Poſt-Maſter at <hi>Frome,</hi> could inform him that the News was at <hi>Frome</hi> that very day the Murder was committed. But the Witneſs ſaid he had been with this <hi>Compton,</hi> who denied it, and told him they had no News of it till Sunday following: And the Lord of <hi>Waymouth,</hi> who lives near <hi>Frome,</hi> told him, that he had an account of it on the <hi>Sunday;</hi> and he believed that was one of the firſt Letters of it that was in the Country.</p>
               <p>Then the Papers were read in Court, which were found about Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> at his Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The firſt was a Letter, ſubſcribed <hi>Hugh Speke,</hi> and dated <hi>London, Lincolns-Inn, Aug.</hi> 15. 1683. Wedneſday Night, 10 a Clock, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, For the ever Honoured Sir <hi>Robert Atkins</hi> Knight of the <hi>Bath,</hi> at his Houſe at <hi>Netherſwell</hi> near <hi>Stow on the Old,</hi> in <hi>Glouceſter-ſhire.</hi> [Which becauſe it was the only thing that engaged Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> in this Trouble, the Reader is preſented with a Copy of it, intire and not abridg'd.]</p>

But indeed,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:152694:178"/>I thinks it could never have fallen on ſo fit a Man, for he has been a very hard Student, and is a Perſon of a very good Reputation, Life, and Converſation, and has a great deal of Prudence, and has as much Courage as any one living whatſoever. He went away on a ſudden hence Poſt towards <hi>Marleborough</hi> to make ſome further Diſcovery, and what he has diſcovered he will give you full account of, and of all the Tranſactions hitherto about it. I lent him my Man to go with him for fear he ſhould come to any Miſchief, for moſt here fear, that he will be either ſtabb'd or knock'd on the Head, if he do not take great care of himſelf; And ſeeing he came into theſe parts, I thought it not amiſs to go and adviſe with you how he had beſt to proceed in it, and I did charge him not to let any Body know who he was, that it might not be known that he had been with you; For I would not for the whole World that you ſhould come to any prejudice in the leaſt for your kindneſs towards us; For we labour under many Difficulties as the Tide runs at preſent.</p>

               <p>Upon the reading of this, a Gentleman ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd from Sir <hi>Robert, Atkins,</hi> to aſſure the Court that he never had the Letter, nor knew any thing of it, and to deſire therefore there might be no Reflections caſt upon him.</p>
               <p>The Attorny General repli'd, 'twas an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy thing to be thought well of, by ſuch ſort of People.</p>
               <p>Then the Information of Mrs <hi>Edwards</hi> of what her Son had ſaid. And the Boy's Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:152694:179"/>As alſo another of <hi>Jane Lodeman,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame Matter; and of one Mr. <hi>William Glasbrooke</hi> to atteſt it; and Mr. <hi>Burgis</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Cumpen,</hi> were read; all which Papers were found on Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> when he was took.— And here the Evidence for the King ceas'd for the preſent.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Wallop</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for the Defendants, opened their Evidence; and called one <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>Marleborough,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be ſworn until Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had paid him his Charges; and then he depoſed, That between the Hours of 3 and 5, riding up <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> within three or four miles of <hi>Andover,</hi> on Friday (the day before the News came to <hi>Marleborough,</hi> and on that very day the Murder was ſaid to be done) a Man told him, that he had heard that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his throat.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Fielder,</hi> a Shop-keeper in <hi>Andover,</hi> depoſed, That it was the common diſcourſe among Women that came in and out of his Shop, and up and down the Town, on Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and Thurſday, preceding the Saturday whereon the certain News came (which was before the thing was done) that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe the Witneſs could not fix the Report upon any particular Perſon, the Ld. Ch. Juſtice, cried out, It was a Contrivance to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the King's Subjects, and ſhew'd a Deſign to pick up Evidence to amuſe the Unwary, and fill their Heads with Fears and Jealouſies of he knew not what.</p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:152694:180"/>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> deſired to make his own Defence, and called Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> again, who depoſed, That the firſt time his Son denied the Report was <hi>July</hi> 17. after Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> came to examine him.</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. <hi>Edwards</hi> depoſed, what the Boy had told her of the Razor, and that he wept when he told it her, but after Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had been at their Houſe, his Siſter telling him when he came from School, that a Gentleman had been to inquire about what he had ſaid, and intimating to him ſome danger, bidding him to ſay the Truth, and not tell a Lie to ſave his Breech, he then denied it; and this was before he ſigned Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Paper, and he knew of his denial.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Sarah Edwards,</hi> her Daughter, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed likewiſe what her Brother had ſaid, but ſaid, ſhe knowing him apt to tell Lies, did not believe him.</p>
               <p>That on Tueſday following, after Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had been there, and ſhe had told her Brother of it, he apprehending ſome danger, did deny it; and in the Afternoon Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> coming again, knew that he had denied it; upon which he talk'd to the Boy, and told him the danger of Lying, and bid him ſpeak the Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And on Wedneſday Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> coming again, the Boy then owned it again, and he writ down what he owned, and ſaid he would be carried to Sir <hi>Henry Capel,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Next day Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> came again, with another Paper written, to which the Boy, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unwillingly ſet his Hand.—But Mr.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:152694:180"/>
                  <hi>Braddon</hi> asking her, what her Brother's Anſwer was to him, when he asked him, why he had denied it? ſhe ſaid, ſhe could not recollect that; though ſhe confeſs'd the Boy ran to his Mother, and cried out, he ſhould be Hang'd; and that he was told that his Father would be in danger of loſing his Place, and the Family ruin'd.— But Mr. <hi>Wallop</hi> then asking her, if ſhe did not tell him, the King would hang his Father if he did not deny it? The Ld. Ch. Juſtice, inſtead of ſuffering her to Anſwer, not only upbraided that ancient learned, and worthy Gentleman, as if he intended to charge the King with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of hanging Men, if they denied not the Truth; but having huffed and hector'd him, did threaten him with the Animadverſion and Correction of the Court for reflecting upon, and aſperſing the Government; telling him, he was impetuous in the worſt of Cauſes. And there was ſuch a heat in this Cauſe, he wondred whence it ſhould come, he was ſure Not from the Honeſty of it.—But old Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> being asked, that the Boy own'd that it was Fear and Diſcouragement through his Siſter's Threats, was the Cauſe of his denying it.</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. <hi>Ann Burt,</hi> depoſed, That ſhe was preſent, and Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> when Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> took the Examination of the Boy; and that ſhe heard the Boy own what he had ſaid; and that his Mother told her, that the reaſon of his denying it before, was, becauſe his Siſter had been talking to him. But the Ld. Ch. Juſtice would not permit her to go on with ſuch Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays, and ſo broke off her Evidence.</p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:152694:181"/>
               <p>Then <hi>Jane Lodeman,</hi> a Girl of 13 Years old, was ſworn, and depoſed, That ſhe being in the Tower, <hi>July</hi> 13 laſt, between 9 and 10 a clock, did ſee a Hand throw a bloody Razor out of a Window, which ſhe was told belonged to the E. of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Lodgings; and ſhe heard either two Shrieks or two Groans preſently after: That the Razor fell within the Pales; and ſhe ſaw a Woman in a White Hood come out, but did not ſee her take it up. Then the Girles <hi>Information</hi> which Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had took from her, was ſhewed, wherein was, that ſhe heard a Soldier call for ſome Body to come out and take up a Razor; but ſhe ſay'd ſhe does not know the Soldier was there, and ſhe heard no Body ſpeak to the Maid; And that ſhe had no knowledge of Young <hi>Edwards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Margaret Smith</hi> was ſworn, who was very ſhy of ſpeaking; any more than that, (ſhe being the Girles Aunt) the Girl told her what ſhe had ſeen; and that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and took her Information.</p>
               <p>Then one <hi>William Glasbrooke,</hi> living in the ſame Houſe with <hi>Lodeman,</hi> depoſed, That he being up two pair of Stairs when the Girl came in from the <hi>Tower,</hi> did hear her telling what ſhe had ſeen to her Aunt, and that her Aunt chid her for it, but ſhe ſaid ſhe was ſure it was true; That he had before that time taken her in a Lie, and thought her a lying Girl.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>William Smith,</hi> a Barber in <hi>Throgmorton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> depoſed, That he went along with Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> and was preſent, when he took the Girls <hi>Information,</hi> and that ſhe then did ſay, She
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:152694:181"/>heard a Man ſay to them in the Houſe, <hi>Here is a Razor;</hi> which was all he remembred as to that particular. The <hi>Information</hi> was then ſhew'd him, and he own'd his Hand, and ſaid he did read it over, and it was nothing but what the Girle ſaid, he was ſure.</p>
               <p>[But becauſe he had not repeated all about the <hi>Souldier,</hi> the Ld. Ch. Juſtice, told him he was a Notable ſhaver upon his Word! A ſpecial Fellow I'de warrant him!]</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. <hi>Mewx</hi> was ſworn, who would have depoſed, That ſhe travelling into <hi>Berkſhire, July</hi> 12. the day before the Earl of <hi>Mſſex</hi>'s Death, her Daughter then told her in the Coach, how ſhe had heard it reported, That one of the Lords committed for the late Plot had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower;</hi> But the Daughter being with Child, and near her time, and therefore not daring to venture abroad, much leſs into the Court, the Ld. Ch. Juſtice would not ſuffer the Mother to be examin'd, though ſworn; alledging, That becauſe ſhe could not depoſe on her own Knowledg, it was no Evidence, and therefore againſt all Judicial Forms to admit it. But Mr. <hi>Wallop</hi> replied, <hi>It was Evidence there was ſuch a Talk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Jeremiah Burgis</hi> depoſed, That he being at <hi>Frome; July</hi> 13. did hear it reported in his Inn, that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> coming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to <hi>Marleborough</hi> to examin him about it, he did write that Letter to <hi>Frome,</hi> and gave it Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> to carry; and that through a miſtake he writ the 6th of <hi>July</hi> inſtead of the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:152694:182"/>13th, (which was the Day whereon he heard the Report) but, upon Mr. <hi>Braddon's</hi> obſerving it, he preſently mended it.</p>
               <p>[Upon which the Ld. Ch. Juſtice preſently call'd it a Juggle, not ſparing his Affronts and Diſcouragements while he was delivering his Evidence; the Attorny General pritty well ſeconding him.]</p>
               <p>After this Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> moved for his Client Mr. <hi>Speke,</hi> as not being concern'd in this Buſineſs, either before or after, any otherwiſe than by that Letter.</p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> deſiring leave to ſpeak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, related the whole Paſſage, how he came to lend Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> (being his acquaintance) his Man and Saddle, and to recommend him by Letter; which he writ to have him take good Advice in what he did; and that it was late at Night when he writ, and had been drinking, and might not ſo well conſider what he did.— But for all that; Mr. Attorny General ſaid that his Letter was ten times worſe than what Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had done. But the Ld. Ch. Juſtice ſaid, He would not have Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> topped upon; nor ſuffer ſuch a Reflection on him, that any Man ſhould be a greater Actor in this Buſineſs than he.</p>
               <p>Then the Attorny General proceeded to the Proof of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Murdering himſelf; <q>which the Ld. Ch. Juſtice ſaid was neceſſary to ſatisfy the World; though to a diſcerning Eye there was enough given from this Day's Evidence, to make it appear a moſt Malicious and Scandalous Contrivance, to hawk about
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:152694:182"/>for every idle Rumor, to pick up Children of ſuch Tender Years, and make them ſwear any thing to ſerve a Turn.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Paul Bomeney</hi> was ſworn, (the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Servant) who depoſed, That his Lord having long Nails, asked for a Pen-knife; and on the Thurſday, he ſending the Footman for other Things to the Steward, he writ a Line at the end of a Note, that he ſhould ſend a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife — That the Footman brought the other things, but not the Pen-Knife, becauſe the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard ſent word he had none, but would ſend one the next Morning; ſo early in the Morning the Footman was ſent again with another little Note for Proviſions, and a <hi>Memorandum</hi> for his Lord's Pen-knife. But his Lord ask'd him for the Pen-knife before the Footman return'd; and not having any, he ask'd him for one of his Razors, which he fetch'd and gave him, and wherewith he ſaw him walking and picking his Nails; and that then he went out and left him, and was talking with the Warder; and looking out of the Window upon the King, who was then in the <hi>Tower;</hi> and in this time the Footman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with the Things, and deliver'd him the Pen-knife, and a Note from Mr. <hi>Billingſley</hi> the Steward to ſhew his Lord; which he coming up to do, found no Body in his Lordſhip's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; ſo thinking he might be in the Cloſet, in which ſtood a Gloſe-ſtool, he came down again, and Hayed till he ſuppoſed his Lord might be come out. Then he went up again, and ſeeing no Body in the Chamber, and the Cloſet Door ſtill ſhut, he knocked three times at
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:152694:183"/>the Door, called on his Lord; but no Body anſwering, he looked through the Chink of the Door, between the Door and the Wall, and ſaw Bloody, and a little part of the Razor: That then he called to the Warder, and the People of the Houſe, who came and found his Lord kill'd, lying all along on his Side, and his Foot againſt the Door, which (opening into the Room) could not be opened eaſily, nor very far; which the Warder puſh'd at, and the Razor lay by his Side.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> the Warder, depoſed, That he heard my Lord ask <hi>Bomeny</hi> for a Razor, and ſaw him give him one; and that none came up to my Lord's Chamber while <hi>Bomeney</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; that <hi>Bomeney</hi> coming up, and making a noiſe, the ran to him, and opened the Cloſſet-Door, the Key being on the Out-ſide, and there ſaw my Lord lie in his Blood, and the Razor by him.—Saying, that the Window was towards a back Yard; — that there was no Light, nor Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage towards the Street into Capt. <hi>Hawley</hi>'s Houſe (where was the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Lodgings) but one Door that goes out from the Entry to go into the Yard.</p>
               <p>Then one <hi>Lloyd,</hi> a Sentinel, dipoſed, That he ſtood at the Street Door that Morning, and he ſaw no Body come into the Houſe, not no Coach ſtand at the Door, nor ho Maid go out in a white Hood, nor no Razor thrown out at the Window, nor did he cry but to any Body; nor was there any other Souldier there but himſelf.</p>
               <p>That Capt. <hi>Hawley</hi> depoſed, how he ſaw my Lord in his Bloods.—That the Caſement won't open far, (the Houſe having ſettled) and is ſo
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:152694:183"/>low, and the Pales nine or ten high, that it is impoſſible for any one to throw any thing out of the Window to be ſeen; and that it was one of the horrideſt and unlikelieſt Reports that ever was heard of.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Spekes</hi> Servant was ſworn, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the ſurprize of his ſudden Journey; but that Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> having got another to go with him, he came back to his Maſter again.</p>
               <p>Then the Ld. Ch. Juſtice asked the Defandants what they had more to ſay? Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſay any thing. Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> urged his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of conſpiring with Mr. <hi>Braddon;</hi> that his being concerned, was but accidental, and a ſurprize to him; and that what he did, was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſignedly, nor with any ill Deſign. Then Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> deſired the Jury to take notice, that there had been nothing proved of evil Practices uſed by him, to perſwade theſe Witneſſes to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify a Falſhood, and deſired them to take no ether notice of any thing that had been, or ſhould be ſpoken, but what had been proved.</p>
               <p>Then the Ld. Ch. Juſtice ſumm'd up the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <q>repreſenting the Crime very odiouſly, as carrying all the Venom and Baſeneſs, the greateſt Inveteracy againſt the Government that ever any Caſe did that he ever met with. Inſinuating, That becauſe the King and the Duke were walking in the <hi>Tower</hi> that day, and near that time when this unfortunate thing happened, now it muſt be whiſpered, as tho the King and the Duke had deſigned this Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.—And that there was <hi>Digitus Dei</hi> in this
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:152694:184"/>Accident, and it was enough to ſatisfy all the World of the Conſpiracy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>After he had finiſh'd his long Speech, full of ſuch-like Expreſſions, the Court aroſe, and the Jury afterwards gave in a private Verdict, which the next Morning was repeated in Court, and recorded. And by that Verdict they found Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> Guilty of the whole Matter charged upon him in the Information; and Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> Guilty of all but the Conſpiracy to procure falſe Witneſſes, and of that they found him <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And on Monday, <hi>April</hi> 21. 1684. the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants being brought to the Bar, their Counſel moved in Arreſt of Judgment; but Judgment being recorded, it was too late, and not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though it was before by conſent agreed for the Defendants this day to move.</p>
               <p>Then after Mr. Juſtice <hi>Withens,</hi> and the Ld. Ch. Juſtice had ſeverely upbraided Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Impudence, becauſe he ſhewed no ſorrow, but ſtill proteſted his Innocency; and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted about the Sentence, Mr. Juſtice <hi>Withens</hi> pronounced it, firſt aggravating Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Crime, as if he had endeavoured to make the King concern'd in the Murder; and would inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate a Sham-Plot to take away Innocent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Lives; telling, the Court, for this Offence, ſet upon Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> the Fine of 2000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and order that he find Sureties for his good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour during Life, and that he be committed till this be performed.</p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:152694:184"/>
               <p>And for Mr. <hi>Speke</hi> (whom they had conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not ſo Guilty) they thought fit to ſet upon him the Fine of 1000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and that he find Sureties for his good Behaviour during his Life, and be committed till he perform it.—After which they were carried away to the <hi>King's-Bench.</hi>

By whom, while he was gone for a little while, his Name was put into a Warrant, to be a ſpecial Bailiff to arreſt the Lord Mayor; which he ſeeming unwilling to do, was urged thereto, for fear of diſpleaſing the Diſcontented Party; (which he ſaid were ſuch as he and the <hi>Goodenoughs</hi> were of, even ſuch as would have killed the King and the Duke) that being prevailed upon, he went along with the Coroner, Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Francis Goode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,</hi> to <hi>Grocers-hall,</hi> where Sir <hi>William Pritch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> kept his Mayoralty, to whom the Coroner came up and ſaid he had a Warrant againſt him, and therefore pray'd him to give an Appearance at the Suit of Mr. <hi>Thomas Papillon,</hi> and another at the Suit of Mr. <hi>John Dubois,</hi> whereupon ſome Words paſſed between them and the Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, refuſing to give any Appearance, the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bid us execute our Warrants, upon which he came up to the Lord Mayor, and touched him upon the Shoulder, telling him, that he did ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt him at the Suit of <hi>Thomas Papillon,,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and one <hi>Ferdinando Burley</hi> arreſted him then again at the Suit of Mr. <hi>John Dubois;</hi> and then the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner diſmiſſing them, and taking the Lord Mayor into his own Cuſtody, he went thence
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:152694:191"/>to Sir <hi>Henry Tulſe</hi>'s and arreſted him alſo.</p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>Henry Tulſe</hi> being called and ſworn, depoſed, that about four a Clock in the Aſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> came with two more to his houſe, and arreſted him at the Suit of Mr <hi>Papil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and another of them did the ſame at the Suit of Mr. <hi>Dubois,</hi> telling him, if he would not give Appearance, he muſt go to the Lord Mayor, who was at <hi>Skinners-hall,</hi> but that they would take his word till the Morrow Morning. However he immediately went to the Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's-houſe, and not finding him at home, he went to <hi>Skinners-hall,</hi> where he found him all alone, and no Alderman, only the Officers with him, where he had been but a little while, but was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and he with him, till about eleven a Clock; abundance of People being gather'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about the Door, but a Company of the trained Band-Souldiers coming, keptall quiet.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Wells,</hi> the common Cryer, was called and ſworn, who depoſed, That he being in the next room to the Hall, wherein the Lord Mayor was arreſted, was preſently ſent for to my Lord, who bid him ſend out the Officers to ſummon a Lieutenancy, which he did; and the Sword-Bearer being not juſt then at hand, the Lord-Mayor bid him take the Sword, and go along with him; and ſo they were carry'd by the Coroner to his own houſe, and the Lord-Mayor put up into a little Room by himſelf; and he commanded by him to go and ſee for Sir <hi>James Edwards,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Tulſe,</hi> and the Ld.

               <p>Then Sir <hi>John Peake</hi> was ſworn, who depoſed, that upon the News of the Lord Mayor's being arreſted, he had order from the Lieutenancy to raiſe his Regiment, which he did in a very little time, and came with his Soldier to <hi>Skinners-Hall,</hi> where he heard the Lord Mayor was, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented any ſtir, as it was feared there would have been.</p>
               <p>Here the King's Counſel reſted their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, till they had heard what the other ſaid to it.</p>
               <p>Whereupon Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> (being of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for the Defendant, Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi>) told the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in a very learned and excellent Speech, that the Lord Mayor was as much ſubject to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Law and Actions, as any private Perſon in the City, if he did injury, or that which was not right in his Office: That the Defendant did then ſuppoſe himſelf to have wrong done him, and had therefore probable cauſe to bring his Action, which he had done in a legal Manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>VVilliams</hi> inſiſted upon the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the cauſe of Action; it being a controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Queſtion, Whether Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bois,</hi> or Sir <hi>Dudley North,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Box,</hi> were choſen Sheriffs of <hi>London.</hi> And ſome were ſo much diſſatisfied with ſwearing Sir <hi>Dudley North,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rich Sheriffs,</hi> as thinking them not duly Elected, that they would have the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> moved, for the Writ of <hi>Mandamus</hi> to ſwear Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois;</hi> which <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus</hi> was granted, to which the Mayor and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, to whom it was directed, made a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:152694:192"/>that they were not Elected Sheriffs of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which Return was apprehended to be falſe; and really to try the truth of this Return, was the Action brought againſt the Plantiff; which was the only way they had to right themſelves; and therefore they proceeded regularly, and orderly, in a decent Manner, applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to get an Appearance to their Action; For that firſt they took out a <hi>Latitat</hi> againſt my Lord Mayor, and by the Attorny gave him notice of it, and deſired an Appearance, ſo that the Queſtion in diſpute might come to ſome deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: But he was not pleaſed to give an Appearance to that Writ; ſo they took out a <hi>Capias,</hi> gave him notice of it, and deſired an Appearance, but could have none: whereupon they took out an <hi>alias Capias,</hi> and the Coroner then told, that he ſhould be called upon to make ſome Return to the Writ; which he acquainted the Lord Mayor with, and deſired again an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; which he refuſing, the Officer was conſtrained to arreſt him, and an Appearance at laſt was given: Upon which they declared in the beginning of <hi>Hilary</hi> or <hi>Eaſter-Term</hi> (83.) But it falling out that in <hi>Eaſter-Term</hi> (83,) that that there was an Information for a Riot upon <hi>Midſummer-day</hi> before, about this conteſted Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; which being tried <hi>May</hi> the 10th, was found to be ſo, and the Sheriffs ſworn to be duly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; thereupon being ſatisfied that they were miſtaken, they immediately diſcontinued their Action.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>VVard</hi> (of Counſel alſo for the Defendant) ſpoke; vindicating the Defendant
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:152694:193"/>from ſome unjuſt Reflections, which the King's Counſel had made, as if he had cauſed the Lord Mayor to be Arreſted for the furtherance of ſome deſigned Inſurrection againſt the King and Government; and ſhewing the probability of the Cauſe then, at that time, though it be quite otherwiſe ſince the Queſtion, of the Right and Election being determined on the other ſide, in the Trial about the Riot at the Election. —But the Ld. <hi>Ch. Juſtice.</hi> here interrupting him, would by no means allow that to be the Queſtion then determined; which raiſed ſome Words between them, whereat there was a little <hi>Hiſs</hi> begun, which made the Ld. <hi>Ch. Juſtice,</hi> in a great Fury, ask who that Fellow was that durſt <hi>hum</hi> or <hi>hiſs</hi> while he ſat there; threatning to lay him by the heels, and make an Example of him, ſaying, That indeed he knew the time when Cauſes were to be carried according as the <hi>Mobile</hi> hiſs'd or humm'd, and that he did not queſtion but they had as good a will to it now. —Then he ſuffered the Defendants Counſel to call their Witneſſes; And therefore,</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Brome</hi> being call'd and ſwore, depoſed, That aſter he had the Writs he waited upon my Ld. Mayor, praying his Appearance, and gave him 9 or 10 days to conſider; and that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants Attorny Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> did threaten to complain of him to the Court if he did not make a Return of the Writ.</p>
               <p>And that when, at laſt, he could get no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, the Officers named in the Warrant, by his Command, did arreſt him, and carry him to Skinners-Hall, and that ſoon aſter he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:152694:193"/>was taken into Cuſtody, and committed to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Then after the Ld. <hi>Ch. Juſtice</hi> had croſs'd Queſtions with him, to have forc'd him a fall; Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> was ſwore, who depos'd, That Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> being at his houſe, in came Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> the Attorny, to receive their Orders what he ſhould do; telling them the time was almoſt ſpent, and he had addreſſed himſelf from time to time to the Lord Mayor, and ſome of the Aldermen to get them to appear, but they would not. They told him they had already given him Orders, and deſired that the matter might be brought to ſome Trial or iſſue; and that he ſhould deſire an Appearance to the Action, and if he would give it, take it, and remember my Lord Mayor is the Chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of the City, and pray'd him to carry it with all reſpect and regard imaginable to him. —The Ld. <hi>Ch. Juſtice</hi> then fell violently upon Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> queſtioning him about his owr and Mr.<hi>Bethel</hi>'s Elections; charging the Reaſon of his being Elected the ſecond time, to be becauſe he had not taken the Sacrament and Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Oath, expoſing him, as an intruder into that Office to diſturb the Government, and as if that was it that was deſigned now again by this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Defendant. But (ſaid he) do you think the Government will ever ſuffer it ſelf to be ſniveled at, and overthrown by a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſuch whining Fellows?—And do you think to ſham People into Offices?—No, I tell you, Villany was the Foundation of it, and Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very the Superſtructure; and it is high time it
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:152694:194"/>ſhould be told out, ſince I hear ſome People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to doubt of it as a Queſtion.—Then calling <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Corniſh</hi> Raſcals; he ſaid, they quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd themſelves for an Office, only to put the Kingdom into a Flame; and that the City was in great happineſs and quiet ever ſince the late times of Rebellion and Confuſion, till ſuch time as a couple of buſy Fellows came to get into the publick Offices. And let the whole Party (ſaid he) go away with that in their Teeth, and chew upon it if they will.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> being ſworn, depoſed, That he being preſent at Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi>'s houſe when Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> were there, he heard them give Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> the fame Orders about treating my Lord Mayor decently, as Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> had before depoſed.</p>
               <p>Then, to ſhew the fair proceedings of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant in the Action; Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> was called, and depoſed, That Mr. <hi>Aſton</hi> telling him he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for Sir <hi>William Pritchard,</hi> and had a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi>'s Attorny, he entred up a Diſcontinuance, and paid the Coſts, and had Mr. <hi>Aſton</hi>'s receipt for them.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> offer'd, that apprehending themſelves really choſen Sheriffs, they did in a due courſe of Law, ſue forth their <hi>Mandamus,</hi> directed to the Plaintiff and the Aldermen; and to which there was a Return made; both which were then read in the Court; and then Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> offer'd to ſhew the Reaſons why they thought this <hi>Return</hi> falſe, and thereupon brought their Action. And therefore Mr. <hi>Gilbert Nelſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Wightman,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Leonard Robinſon</hi> were all call'd and ſworn.</p>
               <pb n="367" facs="tcp:152694:194"/>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Nelſon</hi> depoſed, that he was at the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Hall</hi> on <hi>Midſummer-day,</hi> 1682, where there was in Nomination for Sheriffs, he that is now Sir <hi>Dudley North,</hi> Mr. <hi>Box,</hi> Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois;</hi> that he did ſee the Poll-Books after they were caſt up, and the greateſt number was for Mr. <hi>Papillon.</hi> And that upon holding up the Hands, moſt in his Judgment were for Mr. <hi>Papil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and the Sheriffs gave it for <hi>Papillon</hi> and <hi>Dubois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Wightman</hi> depoſed, That he then did take the Pole in one of the Books, and that there were 2400 and odd for <hi>Papillon</hi> and <hi>Dubois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> depoſed, that he was then alſo at the <hi>Common-Hall,</hi> and that by the Hands he judged the Majority was much more for <hi>Papillon</hi> and <hi>Dubois</hi> than for the other two; That a Poll was demanded and granted, and in the Evening, after the Poll was cloſed, the Books were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred up, and the Sheriffs came down upon the <hi>Huſtings,</hi> and declared above 2000 for <hi>Papillon</hi> and <hi>Dubois,</hi> and ſome hundreds under for the other two.</p>
               <p>Then here, the Counſel for the Defendant, declared they would leave it, unleſs further oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhould be given them.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Attorney-General,</hi> for the Plaintiff, pleaded that the Defendant had not at all proved any probable Cauſe for his Action; for that this matter contended for, (which was the <hi>Shrevalty,</hi> an Office of Burthen, Hazard and Charge) could never be a good ground to bring an Action for; and that he could have no Title to that Office, his Election which was by the Poll, being illegal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:152694:195"/>managed by an uſurp'd Authority; and the Inſtruments made uſe of to bring about this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (ſuch as <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and the Cabal at <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s of 30 or 40 Rioters, moſt of them in the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, proſcribed as Traitors, and run away from Juſtice upon the Diſcovery of the Plot) ſpeaking the worſt of malice.</p>
               <p>To which Mr. <hi>Sollicitor-General</hi> added, that that Poll, by which he ſuppoſed his right to the Office, was illegal, and therefore could afford him no probable Cauſe for an Action. And to prove it ſo,</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Town-Clerk</hi> was ſworn, who depoſed that he never knew a Poll for Sheriffs till about 5 or 6 Years ago, and it was between Mr. <hi>Jenks</hi> and Sir <hi>Simon Lewis,</hi> and that it was by the direction of the Lord Mayor; and the Sheriffs are but Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and not the Judges and Managers of the Poll, without the Lord Mayor's direction.</p>
               <p>Then Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> did plead for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, that however, the liſting up of 2000 hands might well make him apprehend himſelf as cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and that there lay the cauſe of his Action; and his ſuing for ſo troubleſome an Office might be objected to the prudence of Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> but could prove nothing of Malice in him. And though the Attorny he made uſe of was a bad Man, yet that did not make all his Clients bad. And therefore he leſt it to the Jury the Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Malice of the Action, with the Damages the Plaintiff could poſſibly have ſuſtained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> pleaded the doubtfulneſs of the Queſtion, notwithſtanding what the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:152694:195"/>
                  <hi>Town-Clerk</hi> had depoſed concerning the right of managing Polls; and that therefore they might eaſily be miſtaken; and that they brought their Action to try the Right; but afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they were out, and had no Right, they diſcontinued and deſiſted; and that thus they would leave it with the Jury.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> remembering that Mr. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny General did challenge the Defendant, to ſhew that his Action was brought by Advice of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, Mr. <hi>Baker</hi> was called again, who depoſed that it was by the Advice of Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pollixfen,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wallop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then both ſides having nothing more to ſay, the Ld. <hi>Ch. Juſtice</hi> directed the Jury in a very long and virulent Speech; ſhewing the improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Cauſe of the Defendants Action, from the Sheriff's having no Power to manage the Poll; and the Malice of it from theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attending it. As. 1. for a Man to ſue to be Sheriff looks ſomewhat extraordinary; as if he had a mind to do ſomewhat unuſual in his Place, eſpecially when a Man has fined for the Office once before, as Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> did: And it is a thing was never known till theſe unhappy times. 2. That for ſeveral years laſt paſt the Government hath been beſet, and the Methods of Juſtice corrupted, and all to ſerve the main Deſign of ſubverting the Government; by Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows getting into Office that were obnoxious to the Government, and known Diſſenters, who never thought of conforming but only to capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate themſelves to deſtroy the Government; by packing <hi>Ignoramus Juries;</hi> ſo that Men took
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:152694:196"/>Oaths only to ſanctify Villany; and Traitors at the Bar were in leſs danger of being convicted of their Treaſons, than the Judges were of their Lives: And that theſe things never were till <hi>Corniſh</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> got in to be Sheriffs. 3. Their arreſting the Lord Mayor in his Mayoralty-year, and not ſtaying till that was ended, did carry Vengeance and Malice in the very face of it; as if they had a mind to affront the Government, in arreſting and impriſoning the Kings Lieutenant, in one of the higheſt Places both of Truſt and Honour. Nay, and becauſe they would be ſure their Malice and Revenge ſhould take place, 4. They took the very <hi>Scoundrels</hi> of the Party to be employed in this work.—5. The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents deſigned herein, which was the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Government, all the Magistrates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing took up that had any care for it. And 5. The particular Perſons that were to be ſued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only ſome of the Aldermen, and not all, though the <hi>Mandamus</hi> was directed to all, and the Return made by the whole Court; yet <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> and his Party were not to be medled with, which is another Circumſtance of Malice. And if it had not been for ſome Purpoſe, 6. Mr. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillon</hi> is know to be a Perſon that would never have been ſo greedy of an Office he had before declined and fined for; minding rather his Counting-houſe than a Scarlet-Gown; And therefore the Deſign (he told them) was from the beginning to the end, nothing but to cauſe a Tumult and Confuſion in the City, in order to put that damned helliſh Conſpiracy for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the King and his Brother, and every
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:152694:196"/>Man that was honeſt and loyal, in Execution.</p>
               <p>That therefore they were to find for the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, and to give Damages according to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice deſign'd; not as to Sir <hi>William Pritchard,</hi> but as Lord Mayor; For that the Government was infinitely concern'd in this Cafe, which made it ſo popular a Cauſe. The Government of the City, the Honour of their Chief Magiſtrate, and indeed the Honour of the King, whoſe Subſtitute he was, and that was to put a weight upon their Inquiry into the Damages of this Caſe; telling them, that their ſeverity in this Caſe, would deter all People from entring into Clans and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals to make Diſturbances, and affront the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>Then the Jury withdrew to conſider of their <hi>Verdict,</hi> and after half an hours ſtay, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and found for the Plaintiff, and aſſeſſed Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to 10000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and coſts to 4 Marks.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> then told the Jury that they ſeem'd to be Perſons that had ſome ſenſe upon them, and conſideration for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and had given a good Verdict, and were to be greatly commended for it.</p>

               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Clement Smith</hi> (another Student of the ſame Colledg, and of the ſame Claſs with Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> whom the Doctor challenged for a Jeſuit) ſwore the Priſoner's being at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> from <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> 1677, to <hi>Midſummer</hi> 1678, New Stile: And that he remembred particularly as to <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> becauſe the 22 ſt of <hi>April</hi> he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fell ſick in the Colledg, and went into the Infirmary till <hi>May</hi> 7.

That the Priſoner alſo was in the Infirmary for two or three days in this time; and that he ſpoke this piece of falſe Latin to his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, <hi>Si placet Dominatio veſtra.</hi>—That he heard of the Conſult, and knew of Mr. <hi>Marſh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> two Fathers, going over then to it.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Edward Price</hi> (another of the ſame) ſwore to <hi>Oates</hi>'s coming to St. <hi>Omers</hi> at <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> and of his going away at <hi>Midſummer;</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members particularly his being there when the two Jeſuits <hi>Marſh</hi> and <hi>VVilliams</hi> were coming over to the Conſult. And that had he been abſent, he muſt needs have been miſs'd, he was ſo noted for his Abſurdities, and frequent Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellings with the Students.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>James Doddington</hi> (another of the ſame, who went by the Name of <hi>Hollis,</hi> and was a Witneſs at the Trial of the five Jeſuits) ſwore likewiſe to the ſame purpoſe, of <hi>Oates</hi>'s being reſident from <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> to <hi>Midſummer</hi> at St. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> except one Night at <hi>Watton.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>William Gerrard</hi> (another alſo of the ſame, who went by the Name of <hi>Clovell</hi>) ſwore the ſame Story of <hi>Oates</hi>'s reſidency at that time at St. <hi>Omers;</hi> and that he heard of the Conſult, but that <hi>Oates</hi> was not capable of being at it, becauſe none but Jeſuits of 18 Years ſtanding could be preſent; That on <hi>May</hi> 16, <hi>Oates</hi> and he were confirm'd together.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Gerrard</hi> of <hi>Bromeley</hi> (being ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame, going by the Name of <hi>Clovell</hi>) depoſed the ſame Evidence: remembring the Priſoner's reading in the Sodality particularly by his Tone.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Samuel Morgan</hi> (now a Benefic'd Miniſter, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> being reconciled five Years ſince) depoſed the ſame concerning <hi>Oates</hi>'s coming to, and going from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> (himſelf being then a Student there) and that reading <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Trial, the impudence of <hi>Oates</hi> was much wondred at in the Colledg, for ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was at the Conſult on <hi>April</hi> 24, when all the Colledg knew to the contrary; and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did remember, that on that very day he was playing at Ball, and ſtruck it over into a Court, and borrowed Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Key to fetch it.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Arundel</hi> (a St. <hi>Omer</hi>'s Student, who went there by the Name of <hi>Spencer</hi>) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ſame purpoſe; ſaying, That he ſaw <hi>Oates</hi> confirm'd on <hi>May</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Turbervile</hi> (another of the ſame, his falſe Name <hi>Farmer</hi>) depoſed to the ſame purpoſe; and that he particularly ſaw the Priſoner on <hi>April</hi> 25, 26, 1678. he then
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:152694:200"/>removing into Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s Chamber, and ſaw <hi>Oates</hi> in the Chamber, and at the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Anthony Turbervile</hi> (another Student, his falſe Name <hi>Farmer</hi> alſo) depoſed to the time of the Priſoner's being at St. <hi>Omers</hi> from <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> 1677, to <hi>Midſummer</hi> 1678; and that he was notorious for his Scurrility and Abuſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and that he and Mr. <hi>Thormon</hi> did break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt with him that Morning he left the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Clavering</hi> (another of them) depoſed to the ſame purpoſe, giving this Inſtance, that the Priſoner was at St. <hi>Omers</hi> at that time the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult was, for that he inquired of him, what it was they met for; and for that a Man came to beg Mony of the Students, which himſelf col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for him, and <hi>Oates</hi> refuſed to give him any thing; And that he knew this to be at that time of the Conſult, becauſe enquiry being made how the Man came to get ſo little Mony at <hi>Watton;</hi> it was ſaid, it was becauſe the Fathers were gone to the Congregation in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>John Copley</hi> (another of the ſame) depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed only to the general Teſtimony of the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Reſidence at St. <hi>Omers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> (a Taylor belonging to the Colledg) depoſed the like; only inſtancing the 20th of <hi>April,</hi> that he ſaw him in a Proceſſion from the Sodality to the Church, walking at the latter end among the Rhetoricians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Wright</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (another Student) depoſed only, that <hi>Oates</hi> came to St. <hi>Omers</hi> the Winter,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:152694:200"/>and went away the Summer before the Notice of the Plot was.</p>
               <p>Then Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was permitted to make his Defence; which he did by excepting ſomething againſt the Form of the Indictment; producing the Records of the Conviction of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the 5 <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> urging them as Proof of the Fact, to which he then ſwore; Reciting out of thoſe Trials, the Approbations that were then given to his Teſtimony by the Ld. Ch. Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> and the preſent Ld. Ch. Juſtice, the Recorder; atteſted by Mr. <hi>Robert Blayney</hi>'s Notes, who was alſo ſworn. Urging alſo the Credit his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony once had with both the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to prove it, he called ſeveral Perſons of Quality, and Noblemen, but thoſe who appeared, were Seri. <hi>Maynard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> Earl of <hi>Clare,</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> (late Speaker of the Houſe of Commons) Earl of <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Ld. Ch. <hi>Baron,</hi> Ld. Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>George Treby;</hi> ſome having forgot what had then paſt in the Houſes, others expreſſing but a very indifferent Opinion they had of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner and his Evidence; which made him to ſay, That he found, either the diſtance of time had wrought upon their Memories, or the difference of the Seaſon had chang'd their Opinion, ſo that now they disbelived that, which they believed before, and perhaps for as little Reaſon as they believed him at firſt; For he could not expect that a Man, who believes without a Principle, ſhould not recant that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief without a Reaſon.—But the Court call'd this a Reflection, and ſpar'd him not for it.</p>
               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:152694:201"/>
               <p>The other part of his Defence conſiſted of his endeavouring to prove that he was here ſeen in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 1678. To this end Mrs. <hi>Cicilia Mayo,</hi> Sir. <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, depoſed, That ſhe ſaw Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> at her Maſter's Houſe in <hi>Barbacan</hi> the latter end of <hi>Apr.</hi> or beginning of <hi>May,</hi> being about a Week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> in that Year the Plot broke out;—That the Coachman told her he had been there once or twice before, but this was the firſt time ſhe ſaw him, he having on grey Clothes, a white Hat, and a ſhort Periwig, and dined there, with her Lady's Siſter, and others, Sir <hi>Richard</hi> being then ſick in the Country. That he came afterwards, when ſhe ſaw him in black Clothes, a longer Periwig, which was brown. That ſhe never knew the Priſoner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then, but they told her who it was.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>John Butler</hi> (Sir <hi>Richard Barker's</hi> Coachman) depoſed, That he alſo ſaw Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> at his Maſter's Houſe the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> before the Plot, in a diſguiſe, having on a grey Coat, and white Hat, and his Hair cut ſhort, but without a Periwig, enquiring for Dr. <hi>Tongue;</hi> Mrs. <hi>Mayo</hi> then alſo looking upon him in the Court, through the Window. And that afterwards he came in a Cinnamon-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Coat, and green Ribbons, and a long black Periwig; and that he dined there ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>mes.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Philip Page,</hi> (Sir. <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s Man that uſed to make up his Phyſick for him) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, That he remembred he did ſee the Priſoner at his Maſters, in grey Clothes, but he
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:152694:201"/>was not certain as to the time, only he believes it was in <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> (a Miniſter) depoſed, he met the Priſoner in a Diſguiſe, between St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s-Lane, and <hi>Leiceſter</hi>-Fields, not exactly remembring the Time when; only he thought it about a Year and a quarter before he was firſt examin'd, and that the Elm-Trees were then budded forth as big as an Hazle-Nut.</p>
               <p>After this, reflecting on the diſcredit the St. <hi>Omers</hi> Witneſſes had once been in, and of their not proſecuting of this Cauſe before this time, he concluded his Evidence. And the King's Counſel proceeded to anſwer his Defence; producing the Records of Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Caſtlemaine</hi>'s Trials to prove that his Evidence there was not believed; which were read; and Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> being ſworn, depoſed what it was the Priſoner then ſwore againſt him, and proteſted the falſity of it, and his own Innocency.</p>
               <p>The ſame alſo the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> did in like manner.</p>
               <p>And then the Lords Journals were produced, where it was recorded that the Priſoner ſaid, he could accuſe no Body elſe but thoſe that he named, and yet ſoon after he accuſed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King, and the Queen-Dowager; but this (upon ſearch) being not found to be a Record upon Oath, it was not thought valid Evidence. Therefore they proceeded to prove his Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of one <hi>Clay,</hi> which was a Witneſs for the Priſoner at the Trial of the five Jeſuits, whom now he did not call; and of Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:152694:202"/>the School-maſter of <hi>Iſlington.</hi> To this end, part of <hi>Oates</hi>'s Narative was read out of the Lords Journal, wherein he accuſed this <hi>William Smith</hi> as concerned in the Plot, as endeavouring to vilify the Houſe of Commons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then a Certificate was read under <hi>Oates</hi>'s Hand of this <hi>Smith</hi>'s Honeſty, not three days before the Trial of the five Jeſuits; whence they would infer he had been tampering with him; the which <hi>Smith</hi> himſelf, being ſworn, was ready to have depoſed; but the Ld.Ch. Juſtice would not admit him to ſwear that he did forſwear himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch ſhould never have the Countenance of ever being Witneſſes again.</p>
               <p>Therefore they proceeded to prove the Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Clay;</hi> and to this end <hi>Lawrence Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> in whoſe keeping <hi>Clay</hi> was in Priſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and the Priſoner did hang'd, for that they could prove him to be a Priest, unleſs he would ſwear for <hi>Oates,</hi> that he dined with him at Mr. <hi>Howards</hi> in <hi>May;</hi> which he conſented to, ſo he might have his Mony reſtored that was taken from him; ſaying, he had been a Rogue before, and did not know what he might be. And this another Witneſs produced, ſwore that <hi>Davenport</hi> told to him the next day in Priſon.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> depoſed, That <hi>Clay</hi> was miſtaken in his Teſtimony given at the Trials of the five <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> in being <hi>July</hi> and not <hi>May</hi> 1678, that he and <hi>Oates</hi> were at his Houſe; about which time there was no queſtion of his being in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:152694:202"/>
               <p>Then they read out of <hi>Oates</hi>'s Narrative again; wherein he had ſaid how he return'd three or four days after the Conſult of <hi>April</hi> 24 was over; obſerving hence how his own Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes contradicted him, who had depoſed that they ſaw him here in <hi>London</hi> the latter end of <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here the Counſel for the King concluding their Evidence, Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> proceeded with his Defence; only ſhewing out of the Lords Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal a Copy of their Reſolve, That there was a Plot; and of their ſummoning up before them <hi>Thomas Bickley</hi> of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> for vilifying Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and thereupon turning him but out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; objecting five things againſt their Evidence.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Their <hi>Religion;</hi> A Papiſt not being a good Witneſs in a Cauſe of Religion, appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Heavens.—Which the Ld. Ch. Juſtice call'd a Common-wealth appeal; and bid him to be took away, falling very foul upon the poor Doctor.—But ſtood in't that 'twas Law, and the Lord <hi>Cooke</hi>'s practice, quoting <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrode</hi>'s Reports, 2d. Part, 155.</p>
               <p>He Objected, (2.) Their <hi>Education,</hi> confeſſing themſelves to be bred up in a Seminary, which is againſt Law, quoting 27<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 2. and 3. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. Cap. 2. Which alſo was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Their Judgments in Caſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby they own they have Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſwear Lies for the promotion of the Cauſe.</p>
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:152694:203"/>
               <p n="4">(4.) It was refuſed at the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Trial, to ſuffer the King's Evidence there to be Indicted of Perjury.—But all this, the Ld. Ch. Juſtice told him was idle, and nothing to the Purpoſe; And therefore he went on to ſum up his Evidence, proteſting the Truth of his Evidence, and that he was reſolved to ſtand by, and ſeal it with his Blood; which the Ld. Ch. Juſtice told him it was pitty but he ſhould.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Sol. Gen. ſumm'd up the Evidence (which while he was a doing Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> beg'd leave to withdraw, being weak and ill with the Stone and Gout, and having lien in Irons 21 weeks); After him the Ld. Ch. Juſtice ſumm'd up the Evidence, with all the Virulency and Gall his Wit or Malice could aſſiſt him. And then the <hi>Jury</hi> withdrawing for about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, deliver'd in their Verdict, That the Defendant was <hi>Guilty of</hi> the <hi>Perjury</hi> whereof he was Indicted; which being Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, The Ld.

               <p>THE Priſoner then and there appearing, was arraign'd upon an Indictment of High-Treaſon, for conſpiring the Death of the late King, and Subverſion of the Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which (after ſome Complaints) he pleaded <hi>Not Guilty:</hi> deſiring his Trial might be deferr'd, he having had no notice till laſt Saturday at twelve a Clock, and he could get no Friend to him till eight at Night, and then he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſpeak with no body, but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Goaler; and had been allowed no Pen, Ink, or Paper. The Court here told him he ought to have none without leave given on a Petition preferred by him. He ſaid his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had petitioned the King the Night before to put off his Trial, and it was referred to the Judges; and that he did not know whether he was committed for High-Treaſon againſt the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:152694:213"/>preſent or the former King; and that he had a material Witneſs in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> 140 Miles off. The Court told him they had ho power to put off his Trial, and the King had left him to the courſe of the Law. He complained he had no Copy of the Pannel; but was anſwered, it was not his right to have it; and the Attorney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral told him he had not deſerved ſo well of the Government, as to have his Trial delayed. He deſired then Pen and Ink, and having challenged thirty five, the Jury were ſworn, which had paſſed upon Mrs. <hi>Gaunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whom the Indictment was read and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. <hi>Phips</hi> and Mr. Attorney General, and then Colonel <hi>Rumſey</hi> depoſed that about the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> or beginning of <hi>November,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> deſired him to go to Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s Houſe, where was a meeting of the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> Ld. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Ld. <hi>Grey,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Armſtrong,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shepherd.</hi> He came late, and they were juſt upon going away. He deliver'd his Meſſage, and they told him that Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> had diſappointed them. He had not been there above a quarter of an Hour, but Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> was called down, and brought up Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> who excuſed his not coming ſooner; and ſaid that he could not ſtay, for he was to meet about the Charter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> opened his Boſom, from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Stomacher pulled out a Paper. They told Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> they had had it read, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to read it to him. Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> read it, while Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> held the Candle; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards asking Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> how he liked it, he
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:152694:214"/>ſaid he liked it very well. The Paper was a Declaration to have been diſperſed when the Riſing was, which was intended about that time; and 2 Points he obſerved and very, well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, the one was for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> the other for Reſtoration of Church or King's Lands, to them that would aſſiſt.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> ſaid he liked the Declaration, and what poor Intereſt he had he would join with it. That he had been acquainted with Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 14. Years, and had had great concerns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; he having returned 3 or 400000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> for him, in 6 years Time, while he was Collector of the Kings Cuſtoms at <hi>Briſtol;</hi> that Mr. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> was a very honeſt Man; and it was out of Compaſſion he had not accuſed him before.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Goodenough</hi> was ſworn, and his Pardon read, who depoſed, That there was a Deſign to riſe in <hi>London,</hi> and the City was divided into 20 parts, and deſign'd out of each part to raiſe 500 Men; who were to take the <hi>Tower,</hi> and drive the Guards out of Town. Before this was agreed on, by chance he was at Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi>'s Houſe (about the buſineſs of the Riot) and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing alone with Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> he ſaid, The Law will not defend us, ſome other way was to be thought on. Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> reply'd, he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the City was ſo unready, and the Country ſo ready; that he reply'd, there was ſomething thought to be done here, but that in the firſt place, the <hi>Tower</hi> ought to be ſeized, where the Magazine is; Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> pauſed a little, and ſaid, I will do what good I can, or what I can, or to that purpoſe. He afterwards met Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> on
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:152694:214"/>the <hi>Exchange,</hi> who asked him how affairs went? to which he gave a general Anſwer, that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Place to talk in, of ſuch Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>To this the Priſoner ſaid, It was ſtrange that Col. <hi>Rumſey</hi> ſeeing him at <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s about ſuch a thing, ſhould never mention it to him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſo often as he ſaw him. Proteſting his ignorance, and appealing to God; urging the Improbability; and adding that <hi>Rumſey,</hi> at the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Trial, ſwore, that he had nothing elſe to ſwear againſt any Man. And againſt <hi>Goodenough</hi> he urg'd the ill Opinion he had of him, and that he never was with him but about the Buſineſs of the Riot, which he manag'd as their Attorny. And I tell you, ſaid Mr. Juſtice <hi>Withens</hi> then, that was a Branch of the Plot; take that from me. Then Mr. <hi>Gosfright</hi> teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> oppoſed Mr. <hi>Goodenough's</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Under-Sheriff, and ſaid he would not truſt an hair of his Head with him; he was ſo ill a Man, obnoxious to the Government, and had done ill things; and he believ'd Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> were never reconcil'd upon it.</p>
               <p>Alderman <hi>Love,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jekyl</hi> teſtified to the ſame purpoſe; which the Ld. <hi>Ch. Juſt.</hi> had ſcarce Patience to hear, ſaying, it was all impertinent, and Mr. Juſt. <hi>VVithens</hi> ſaid of Mr. <hi>Jekyl,</hi> This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was in a limb of the Plot himſelf, as great a Rioter, and as hot as any of them.—Sir <hi>William Turner</hi> then teſtified to Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi>'s averſneſs to <hi>Goodenough</hi>'s being Under-Sheriff. Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> then call'd Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sharp</hi> to teſtify as to his Converſation, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear'd. Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> then teſtify'd that in the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:152694:215"/>Printed Trial of the Lord <hi>Ruſſel, Rumſey,</hi> ſwore he did not hear the Declaration read; but he not hearing it himſelf, that was no Evidence. Then Dr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> the Miniſter of his Pariſh, teſtify'd that he did come often to Church and receive the Sacrament. Then alſo Mr. <hi>Reeve,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Cook,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Knap,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carlton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Joſeph Smart,</hi> and Mr. <hi>VVilliam Crouch,</hi> all teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, as to his Converſation, and Loyalty; whence he argu'd the Improbability that he ſhould be ſo concern'd. After which the Ld. <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſumm'd up the Evidence, and the <hi>Jury</hi> withdrew, and after a conſiderable time return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And then the Priſoner begg'd one Word, deſiring to call Mr. <hi>Shepherd,</hi> whom out of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to offend, he had omitted, though he had him in his Note; which with much ado was granted him, as a great favour of the Court. And then Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> teſtify'd, that he was <hi>Subpoened</hi> by Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> before by the King; and was deſired by Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi>'s Son to be at his Trial, and had been attending in Court from eleven to three. That Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> at one of thoſe Meetings at his houſe came to ſpeak a few Words with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> or ſome other; he could not be poſitive, it being ſo many years ago; that he ſtay'd not above half a quarter of an hour in the houſe; and that there was not one word read, nor no Paper ſeen while he was there; and that he never was at his houſe but once when the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was there; nor does he remember that <hi>Rumſey</hi> was there while he was; nor that the Declaration was read that night. He remembred a Declaration
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:152694:215"/>was read, which <hi>Ferguſon</hi> pull'd out of his Shoe, but was poſitive <hi>Corniſh</hi> was not by, becauſe he was not look'd upon to be one of the Company. That there was now an Accompt depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Mr. <hi>Corniſh,</hi> whereon there was about one or two hundred Pounds due to Mr. <hi>Corniſh.</hi> Then Mr. <hi>Sol. Gen.</hi> ſum'd up the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And the <hi>Jury</hi> withdrawing for a ſhort time, brought Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> in <hi>Guilty,</hi> and found 140 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> for the King, in Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s hands.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Recorder</hi> ſentenced the Priſoners; Mrs. <hi>Gaunt</hi> to be burnt, and the other 3 to be <hi>drawn, hang'd and quarter'd;</hi> which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly executed upon them; and Mr. <hi>Corniſh</hi> was hang'd, in <hi>Cheapſide</hi> over againſt <hi>Kings-ſtreet,</hi> on <hi>Friday, October</hi> 23, 1685. and his Quarters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards put up in ſeveral Places, and his Head upon the <hi>Guild-Hall;</hi> where it ſtood till the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Dutch Invaſion, ſummon'd it, with the other Quarters, into the Grave; after they had been expos'd in that infamous manner the ſpace of 3 Years.</p>

               <p>And then the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was firſt ſworn, Who gave the ſame account about the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s deſign'd Inſurrection, as before he had done at the other Trials, where he was a Witneſs (to which therefore the Reader is referred)</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> depoſed that <hi>Cheſhire</hi> was one of the Places pitch'd upon for the Riſing,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:152694:217"/>and for that end the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> went his Progreſs into thoſe Parts to make his Intereſt there, and that the Priſoner was one he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to adviſe with.—That after the late King's Death the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> with the Lord <hi>Argyle,</hi> where there was an Account given of the Deſign that was in Hand, of an Inſurrection in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and at that time came over to <hi>Holland</hi> Mr. <hi>Crag</hi> from Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> to promote and recommend a Reconciliation between the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and the Lord <hi>Argyle,</hi> who till that time had acted in ſeparate intereſts; giving ſome account that Means and Money were prepared. This encouraged the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to ſend Capt. <hi>Matthews</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> to Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> to deſire him to acquaint ſeveral Perſons, among whom the Priſoner was one, that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to join the Lord <hi>Argyle.</hi> When <hi>Crag</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Duke, he gave an account that Major <hi>Wildman</hi> had convers'd with theſe Perſons, and that their Opinion was, that the Duke ſhould go for <hi>Scotland;</hi> whereby they might know the ſtrength of the Enemy here, by their ſending to ſuppreſs the Rebellion there; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that Major <hi>Wildman</hi> deſired the Duke to bring over with him a Broad Seal to ſeal Commiſſions with, and to take upon him the Title of King. —That ſoon after <hi>Crag's</hi> return, <hi>Jones</hi> came with a Meſſage to the Duke from <hi>England,</hi> and was ſent back ſhortly after by the Duke, with a Letter of Inſtructions. And the Duke intended firſt to have landed in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> he very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon that County; but afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:152694:218"/>that the Perſons there being of great Quality and Intereſt in their Country, and able to manage it without his Aſſiſtance, he choſe rather to land in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> the Friends he rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on there not being of that Quality.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Wade</hi> depoſed that at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſoon after the Death of the late King, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Argyle</hi> had a Conſultation together, and agreed, that at the ſame time the Lord <hi>Argyle</hi> made an Inſurrection in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Duke ſhould invade <hi>England.</hi> For which end the Duke ſent Capt. <hi>Matthews</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England</hi> to acquaint his Friends, (among whom he heard the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> named) to be ready for his Aſſiſtance. <hi>Crag</hi> was ſent over for Money, but could get none, and therefore the Duke ſent him over again to pawn his Jewels, and get what Money he could, wherewith he fitted out 3 Ships, laden with Ammunition; and having before ordered his Friends to repair to their own Countries to be ready, he ſet Sail, and landed at <hi>Lyme,</hi> and ordered his March ſo, as that he might moſt conveniently meet with his <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Friends. In purſuance whereof they came to <hi>Keinſham</hi> Bridge, where a Party of the Kings Horſe ſet upon them, of whom they took ſome Priſoners, and thereupon thought it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable not to let the Kings Army joyn together, but to go back and engage thoſe that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come together, which was the reaſon they did not go over the Bridge.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Goodenough</hi> depoſed, that he was beyond Sea with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and that <hi>Jones</hi> was ſent (among other Perſons) to the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:152694:218"/>Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> to give him notice to be ready, and take care he was not ſeized in Town; and that he heard the Duke ſay that he hoped my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> would not break his Promiſe with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jones</hi> depoſed, that he went into <hi>Holland</hi> the latter end of <hi>April</hi> laſt, and by him Mr. <hi>Diſney</hi> ſent a Meſſage to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to keep to the laſt Concluſion which he would find in a Letter ſent to him by the Crop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hair'd Merchant: which Meſſage was, that his Friends in <hi>England</hi> would not by any means have him come for <hi>England,</hi> but that he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue where he was, or if he thought good to go for <hi>Scotland,</hi> they approved of it. This Meſſage he deliver'd to the Duke at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which put him into a great Paſſion, ſaying, this was <hi>Wildman</hi>'s work, who was a Villain; and that it was too late to ſend a Meſſage now, for he was reſolved for <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wildman</hi> ſhould hang with him, or fight for it with him; and that he ſhould not think to tye up his Hands, by tying up his own Purſe. Sending another Meſſage by him, when he returned for <hi>England,</hi> which was <hi>May</hi> 22d. to Capt. <hi>Matthews</hi> or major <hi>Wildman,</hi> to deſire them to acquaint the Earl of <hi>Maccles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> the Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> and Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> with his Deſign of coming for <hi>England,</hi> and that they ſhould repair to their Poſts to be ready for him; delivering to him a Writing ſealed up, which he was not to open till he came to Sea; which when he opened, he found it contained a Signification of the Place wherein was to land, and where he was to rendezvous, which was <hi>Taunton,</hi> and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:152694:219"/>who were the Perſons that were to have notice of it, among whoſe Names was the Lord <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere</hi>'s. That when he came to <hi>London,</hi> which was <hi>May</hi> 27th, he could meet with neither Capt. <hi>Matthews</hi> nor Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> who were out of Town, and therefore he acquainted Mr. <hi>Diſney</hi> with his errand, who promiſed to take care that it ſhould be delivered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Story</hi> (who was Commiſſary General under the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>) depoſed, that on <hi>May</hi> 28th, one <hi>Brand</hi> told him, that the day before <hi>Jones</hi> was returned out of <hi>Holland,</hi> with a Meſſage to Capt. <hi>Matthews,</hi> but he being abſent <hi>Diſney</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, and diſcourſed that Evening with the Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> and that my Lord went out of Town that Night, with 2 Friends that convey'd him by a By-way through <hi>Enfield</hi> Chaſe towards <hi>Hatfield.</hi>—That this <hi>Brand</hi> was kill'd at <hi>Kein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham</hi> Bridg.—That at <hi>Shepton Mallot</hi> he heard the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſay, that his great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance was upon the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> and his Friends in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> but he fear'd they had failed him or betray'd him; and that he could have been otherwiſe ſupply'd, but that he had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vaux</hi> depoſed. That on <hi>May</hi> 26th, the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> ſent for him to the <hi>Rummer</hi> in <hi>Queens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> and that the next Night he rid out of Town with him about 9 or 10 a clock at Night; and got to <hi>Hoddeſden</hi> about 12; and the next day he brought him to <hi>Hitchen,</hi> and ſo came back again. That my Lord went by the name of <hi>Brown,</hi> and ſaid he was going to ſee his Son that was ſick in the Country.</p>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:152694:219"/>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Edlin</hi> depoſed, that on <hi>May</hi> 27th, Mr. <hi>Vaux</hi> asked him if he would ride with him as far as <hi>Hitchen,</hi> which he promiſed to do; and they ſet out about 9 that Night, and went to <hi>Hoddes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> being in their Company, whom he had never ſeen before, but now knew to be my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> who told them he was going to ſee a Sick Child.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Panceford</hi> depos'd that he was at Mr. <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>'s on <hi>June</hi> 14th laſt, where the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s Declarations were a Printing (for print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof <hi>Diſney</hi> had been Executed) and one <hi>Joſhua Lock</hi> was there waiting for ſome, which he ſaid he was to ſend into <hi>Cheſhire</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Brown;</hi> which he underſtood to be the Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> having heard Mr. <hi>Diſney</hi> call him by that Name, and Mr. <hi>Edlin</hi> having told him how he went by that Name when he rid with him to <hi>Hitchen.</hi> But alſo he had heard that Mr. <hi>Vermuyden</hi> went alſo by that name of <hi>Brown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Babington</hi> depoſed that in their Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there were Diſcourſes of my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> under the name of <hi>Brown;</hi> and once at a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, about the latter end of <hi>May</hi> laſt, when my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> was named by one in the Company, he was preſently catch'd up for it, and replied to, You mean Mr. <hi>Brown.</hi> That, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo at <hi>Diſney</hi>'s while the Declarations were a Printing, he heard one ſay a great many of them were to be ſent into <hi>Cheſhire</hi> to my Lord <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere</hi> under the name of <hi>Brown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hope</hi> (Maſter of the Three-Tuns in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry) depoſed, that the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> came Poſt to his Houſe, he believed 5 times, from
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:152694:220"/>the Sunday Sev'night before the Coronation, to <hi>June</hi> 21, following.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Thomas Saxon</hi> depoſed, that on <hi>June</hi> the 3d or 4th he was ſent for by a Man that had but one Hand, to my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi>'s Houſe <hi>(Mere)</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> where he came when it began to be dark; and was conveyed by the Man that fetch'd him into a lower Room, where were my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Crew Offley,</hi> and they told him, that he had been recommended to them by the Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> who had ſaid, he was an honeſt uſeful Man, and they hoped he would prove ſo: For they had ſent to the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> who was in <hi>Holland,</hi> and received an Anſwer by one <hi>Jones,</hi> which as ſoon as they had, my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> came away Poſt into the Country under another Name, and by being conveyed through <hi>Moorfields</hi> came down to raiſe 10000 Men for the Duke in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> by <hi>June</hi> 1. But now they had conſidered of it, and found they could not raiſe them till <hi>Midſummer,</hi> for that they muſt have time to raiſe 40000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> in that Country to maintain the Men. That they asked him if he would undertake to carry a Meſſage to the Duke? that he ſaid he would. Whereupon the Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> gave him 11 Guinies, and 5 pound in ſilver for his Journy. After which he hired him an Horſe, and did deliver the Meſſage.—That he never had any Concern before with the Ld. <hi>Delamere;</hi> but that the Lord <hi>Brandon</hi> told him, that they muſt make uſe of ſuch as he, to inform the Country of the time of Riſing; his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance abounding that way, being a publick Trades-man in <hi>Middlewich.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:152694:220"/>
               <p>Here the Evidence for the King ceaſing, the Priſoner was called upon to make his Defence. But it beginning to be late, the Priſoner begg'd the Court might be Adjourned till the morrow. But the Lord <hi>H. Steward;</hi> doubted it could not be done by Law, this not being a Trial in full Parliament, (where the Caſe was evident:) But this Court he took to be of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though of a Degree higher, with the other Ordinary Courts of Judicature, where there could be no Adjournment after Evidence given; But for ſatisfaction the Judges were ordered to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw to Conſult, which they did; and then the Lords <hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Falconbridge</hi> moved, that the Peers ought to be the Judges hereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it concerned their Priviledg; and ſo it was alſo permitted for them to withdraw. And after about half an hour the Judges returned, and after an Hour the Peers. And then the Ld. Ch. Juſtice <hi>Herbert</hi> deliver'd the Opinion of the Judges, that this Matter being wholly new to them, they could not determin, but only tell what the Law was in Inferiour Courts in Caſes of the like Nature, and the Reaſon of the Law in thoſe Points, and then leave the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of this Court to its proper Judges. After which the Ld. H. Steward told them, he was the only Judg of that Court, and therefore he was to determin it; ſhewing of what ill Conſequence the Adjournment of the Court might prove, if it ſhould happen to be illegal, and therefore he ordered the Priſoner to proceed.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> therefore did begin his Defence, in Proteſting his Innocency, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:152694:221"/>on the Loyalty of his Family; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly his Father, who had been ſo ſignally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in the Reſtoration of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that the late King cauſed it to be inſerted in the Patent which created his Father a Peer; which Clauſe he read out of the Patent to the Court.—And as to the Evidence againſt him, he obſerved, that it was all but Circumſtantial, and by hear-ſay only, except that of <hi>Saxon</hi>'s; and therefore he apply'd himſelf particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that, and called his Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Hall</hi> teſtify'd how in 1683, <hi>Saxon</hi> counterfeited a Letter, in the Name of one <hi>Richard Hildage,</hi> to him for 6 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> which he ow'd him; and <hi>Saxon</hi> brought the letter, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Mony; and afterwards <hi>Hildage</hi> demanded the Mony, denying that he ever writ for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Francis Ling</hi> declared, how this <hi>Saxon</hi> received 25 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> at this ſame <hi>Hildage</hi>'s at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> for Mrs. <hi>Wibbram,</hi> without her order, nor did ſhe ever receive any of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard Shaw</hi> declared, how he alſo forg'd a Letter in <hi>William Paugſton,</hi> a Bayliffs Name, and ſent it to him, becauſe he owed him a little Mony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter Hough</hi> declared how <hi>Saxon</hi> cheated him, in making him of a Bond for 20 <abbr>
                     <hi>s.</hi>
                  </abbr> leſs than was due from <hi>Saxon</hi> to him; reading it falſe to him at the ſealing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward Wilkinſon</hi> declared, that <hi>Saxon</hi> hired his Horſe, <hi>June</hi> 23d laſt, for only three days, at 12 Pence a Day, but he never came again, nor had he had any ſatisfaction for his Horſe (it being ſuppoſed this was the Horſe he rid into the Rebellion with).</p>
               <pb n="421" facs="tcp:152694:221"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Wright</hi> ſaid, he had dealings with <hi>Saxon,</hi> but never found him ſo good as his Word.—Then the Priſoner went off from this part of the Evidence, to prove that neither Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Offley Crew,</hi> nor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf were in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> at that time <hi>Saxon</hi> had ſworn he ſaw them at <hi>Mere</hi> together.</p>
               <p>And to this end, one <hi>Billing, Margaret Davis,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Sidney Lane, Charles Reeves,</hi> Mr. <hi>Aſhburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Sir <hi>William Twiſden,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Heveningham</hi> did all ſufficiently teſtify that Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> was in Town about that time; and ſome of them (being his own Servants) that he was never in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> ſince <hi>April</hi> 6th laſt, nor never out of <hi>London</hi> till after <hi>June.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to Mr. <hi>Offley Crew,</hi> Sir <hi>Willoughby Aſton</hi> declared every day particularly where he was, from <hi>May</hi> 26. to <hi>June</hi> the 4th, on which day he went from Sir <hi>Willoughby</hi>'s Houſe homeward.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Kid</hi> (his Servants) teſtifyed, that he went directly Home to <hi>Crew-Hall</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> that Night, and was not at <hi>Mere,</hi> it not being in his way at all.</p>
               <p>As to the Priſoner himſelf, Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> (one of his Brother's) declared that he ſaw his Brother in Town, <hi>June</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, and ſo on to <hi>June</hi> 10. till he went out of Town himſelf.</p>
               <p>And another of his Brothers (Mr. <hi>George Booth</hi>) ſaid, he ſaw him in Town the 4th.</p>
               <p>And the Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi> teſtified that he ſaw him the 5th of <hi>June</hi> in the Houſe of Lords at the Lord <hi>Macclesfield</hi>'s Trial againſt Mr. <hi>Fitton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After it was thus cleared, that none of them 3 were where <hi>Saxon</hi> had ſworn they were at that
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:152694:222"/>time; the Priſoner ſhew'd the incredibility of his Evidence, and proceeded to give an account of his going down ſo often, and ſo ſpeedily. That the firſt time he went, (which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Coronation and the fitting of the Parliament) was to take Poſſeſſion of a Leaſe, worth 6 or 7000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> renewed to him by the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> of whoſe illneſs he had notice; and this he proved by Mr. <hi>John Edmonds</hi> who ſaid he was a Witneſs of his taking poſſeſſion, <hi>May</hi> 5th and by Mr. <hi>Henry,</hi> who was <hi>Attorny,</hi> and delivered him Poſſeſſion at the ſame time.—And for his going out of Town <hi>May</hi> 27th the occaſion of it was, to ſee a ſick Child of his; and he went ſo ſuddenly and privately, becauſe he heard there was a Warrant out to apprehend him. But while he was at <hi>Mere,</hi> his Wife ſent him an Expreſs, that as to the Warrant ſhe hoped it was a Miſtake, but that his eldeſt Son was very ill, and if he intended to ſee him alive, he muſt make haſt up. He came but to his Houſe in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> on Sunday <hi>May</hi> 31. Whence he came on Tueſday morning <hi>June</hi> 2d, and on Wedneſday the 3d, he was in Town.</p>
               <p>To prove all this Mrs. <hi>Kelſey</hi> (who was his Servant) ſaid, my Lord told her there was a Warrant out for him, which occaſioned his coming, and moreover his Childs illneſs.</p>
               <p>The Lady <hi>Delamere</hi> (his Mother) teſtified the illneſs of his Child in the Country.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Kelſey</hi> teſtified his coming to <hi>Mere</hi> on Sunday Night, and going thence on Tueſday Morning, and that he had Letters dated <hi>June</hi> 4. which gave an account my Lord got to <hi>London</hi> the Night before.</p>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:152694:222"/>
               <p>And Sir <hi>Thomas Millington</hi> teſtified the illneſs of his Son in Town; on <hi>May</hi> 28. he being ſent for to him, and remembring the time, by the date of his Bills.</p>
               <p>After this the Priſoner ſumm'd up his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and concluded very handſomly and judiciouſly his Excellent Defence.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Sol. Gen. having ſumm'd up the Evidence, and the Lord High Steward ſpeaking a few words to this Point of Law which the Priſoner, in his Defence, ſeemed to urge, <hi>That there is a neceſſity of two Poſitive Witneſſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict a Man of Treaſon,</hi> and ſhewing his Miſtake about it: The Peers withdrew for about half an hour (the Priſoner being taken into a little Room appointed for him at the entrance into the Court) and then being returned, their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance was took by a Serjeant at Arms, and their Verdict took by the Lord H. Steward, <hi>Seriatim,</hi> beginning with the Puiſne Peer, who all declared the Priſoner <hi>Not Guilty upon their Honour</hi>'s. Which the Lord H. Steward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with, being then call'd for to the Bar; and diſcharged.</p>
               <p>Upon which my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> replied, <q>That he ſhould pray to Almighty God, to be thankful to him for his Mercy, and to my Lords for their Juſtice; and pray'd God to deliver their Lordsſhips, and all honeſt Men, from Wicked and Malicious, Lying and Falſe Teſtimony; and pray'd God to bleſs his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and that long he might Reign. And I pray God (added the Lord H. Steward) to
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:152694:223"/>continue to him his Loyal Peers, and all other his Loyal Subjects.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then a Serjeant at Arms having made Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to Diſſolve the Court, the Lord High Steward took the White Staff from the Uſher of the Black Rod, and holding it over his Head, broke it in two.</p>

               <p>Hereupon the Biſhop, and all the Company, were deſired to withdraw; and returning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in about a quarter of an hour, the Chancellor told him, All the Commiſſioners were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that his Requeſt was not to be granted, it being unreaſonable: But they were willing to allow him more time; the Biſhop therefore prayed that he might have till the beginning of the next Term; but a Week vvas thought enough, and ſo they adjourn'd only until Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day next, <hi>Aug.</hi> 9. 1686.</p>
               <p>Then and there the Biſhop came, attended with his Nephew the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> his Brother-in-Law Sir <hi>John Nicholas,</hi> and his Brother Sir <hi>Francis Compton,</hi> &amp;c. There being preſent in Council the ſame as before. The Chancellor told him, they vvere now ready to hear his Reaſons. But the Biſhop replied, He vvas not ſo ready as he might have been, becauſe he could not light of the Commiſſion to ſee it until laſt Night, tho he
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:152694:224"/>imployed all his time to ſearch for it; and he had not had time ſince to take Advice vvhat to anſwer; and that his Counſel vvas out of Town in vvhom he thought to confide. Then vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing for a quarter of an hour, the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor told him, They vvould not admit of any quarrelling vvith their Commiſſion, for that they were well aſſured of the Legality of it: But asking him what Time he deſired, at his requeſt they granted him a Fortnight, and adjourned.</p>
               <p>It vvas obſerved, that vvhen the Biſhop ſpake concerning the Commiſſion, Sir <hi>Thomas Clarges</hi> ſpake aloud, ſaying, <hi>VVell put, well put; my Lord ſpeaks nothing but Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was alſo another Gentleman, Sir <hi>John Lowther</hi> of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> vvho as he vvas coming away in the Crowd, ſaid, <hi>There are ſome who have repreſented me as a Papiſt, but the contrary ſhall appear; I will not be afraid nor aſhamed to vindicate my Lord Biſhop of</hi> London<hi>'s Cauſe, before the Commiſſioners themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſday, <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. 1686. There being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Council the ſame as at firſt, the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop attending, and being asked, what he had to ſay? after ſome Apology for vvhat he vvas about to ſay, he ſaid, His Counſel tells him, that their Proceedings in this Court, are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the Statute-Law, and vvere there ready to plead it if their Lordſhips would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them. But the Chancellor told him, they vvould neither hear him nor his Counſel in the Matter, they being ſatisfied of the Legality of their Commiſſion. Then the Biſhop urged, that their Commiſſion, he conceived, did not extend
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:152694:224"/>to the Crimes laid to his Charge; for they were to cenſure Faults vvhich are committed: But this that he vvas accuſed of, vvas before the Date of their Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>The Chancellor confeſs'd there vvas ſuch a Clauſe, but that thoſe vvere general Clauſes that take in things paſt as vvell as future.</p>
               <p>Then the Biſhop proteſting in his own Right, to the Laws of the Realm, as a Subject; and the Rights and Priviledges of lie Church, as a Biſhop; he would, with their leave, give them his Anſwer. Which was accepted; and the Biſhop withdrew, and left Dr. <hi>Sharp</hi>'s Petition, which Dr. <hi>Sharp</hi> carried on Sunday, <hi>June</hi> 20. 1686. to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and was not admitted to be read.

                           <p>THat nothing is ſo afflictive to your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, as his unhappineſs to have incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your Majeſty's Diſpleaſure; vvhich he is ſo ſenſible of, that ever ſince your Majeſty vvas pleaſed to give notice of it, he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born all publick Exerciſe of his Function, and ſtill continues ſo to do.</p>
                           <p>Your Petitioner can vvith great ſincerity affirm, That ever ſince he hath been a Preacher, he hath faithfully endeavoured to do the beſt Service he could in his Place and Station, as vvell to the late King, your Royal Brother, as to your Majeſty, both by preaching and otherwiſe.</p>

                           <p>And ſo far he hath always been, from vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing in the Pulpit tending to Schiſm or Faction, or any vvay to the diſturbance of your Majeſty's Government, that he hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Occaſions in his Sermons, to the utmoſt of his Power, ſet himſelf againſt all ſorts of Doctrines and Principles that look that vvay: And this he is ſo vvell aſſured of, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but apprehend that his Sermons have been very much miſrepreſented to your Majeſty.</p>
                           <p>But if in any Sermon of his, any Words or Expreſſions have unwarily ſlipp'd from him, that have been capable of ſuch conſtructions, as to give your Majeſty cauſe of Offence; as he ſolemnly profeſſes he had no ill Intention in thoſe Words or Expreſſions, ſo he is very ſorry for them, and reſolves for the future to be ſo careful in the diſcharge of his Duty, that your Majeſty ſhall have reaſon to believe him to be your moſt faithful Subject.</p>
                           <p>And therefore he earneſtly prayeth, that your Majeſty, out of your Royal Grace and Clemency, vvould be pleaſed to lay aſide the Diſpleaſure you have conceived againſt your humble Petitioner, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him to that Favour vvhich the reſt of the Clergy enjoy under your Majeſty's gracious Government.</p>

The Biſhop ſaid, Yes; ſaying, that what he did therein, was by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Counſel, and therefore hoped would not be interpreted to be done maliciouſly or obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately: And that in effect he did what the King commanded to be done, having adviſed Doctor <hi>Sharp</hi> to forbear Preaching, till his Majeſty had received Satisfaction concerning him; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly that he had forborn in his Dioceſs.

And for ſo doing this ſhall be your Warrant: And ſo We bid you heartily farewel. Given at our Court at <hi>Windſor, June</hi> 14. 1686. in the Second Year of Our Reign. By His Majeſty's Command.</p>

               <p>After this the Chancellor ask'd the Biſhop, if he had any more to ſay? Who then deſired his Counſel might be heard, by whom they would have more clear and full Satisfaction concerning what he had ſaid. Whereupon the Biſhop was deſired to withdraw; and after half an hour he and his Counſel were called in, who were Dr. <hi>Oldiſh, Hodges, Prince,</hi> and <hi>Newton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Oldiſh</hi> pleaded, That the King's Letter did not take cognizance of the Cauſe; ſo that it could not be an abſolute Suſpenſion, becauſe that ſuppoſeth a Proof of the Crime charged upon him.—That there was no ſuch word in their Laws, as <hi>ſuſpend from Preaching,</hi> which therefore muſt be meant ſilencing; and this the
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:152694:227"/>Biſhop did, and in ſuch a Method as is obſerved in their Courts.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Hodges</hi> then pleaded, That the Biſhop had done what the King commanded; and that he could not Suſpend, which is a Judicial Act, without firſt a Citation and Hearing; which is the Method of proving before all Courts; and appeared to be ſo in this, otherwiſe the Biſhop needed not to have been cited before them. And that in returning the King an Anſwer, why he did not do what he commanded him, he did but what was his Duty, and what was Law.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Price</hi> pleaded that a Citation was <hi>Jure Gentium,</hi> and could never be taken away by any Poſitive Command or Law whatſoever; that therefore the Biſhop had obeyed the King ſo far as he could, in that he had ſilenced the Doctor; the Advice of a Biſhop being in ſome ſenſe an Admonition, which is a Judicial Act, and was given by the Biſhop, and obeyed by the Doctor.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Newton</hi> pleaded, that the Biſhop had obeyed the King: for as in Nature no Man can be deſired to do what is impoſſible, ſo no man can be obliged to do an unlawful Act; which Suſpenſion, without Citation and Hearing, is.—That the Biſhops are <hi>Cuſtodes Canonum,</hi> and therefore muſt not break them themſelves.—That he had done what was in his Power to do, and it was in effect what the King command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be done: For where he did <hi>Reſcribere,</hi> and heard not the further Pleaſure of the King returned, he ought to conclude, the King was ſatisfied with what he had written, according
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:152694:227"/>to his Duty, and the King had altered his Commands.</p>
               <p>Then the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> ſaid, If he had erred in any Circumſtance, he was very ready to beg his Majeſties Pardon, and would be ready to make any reparation he was capable.</p>
               <p>After which the Biſhop withdrew for half an Hour, and then being called in, was deſired to attend the Court again on <hi>Sept.</hi> 6. So the Biſhop deſiring that care might be took concerning the Minutes taken by the Clerks of what paſſed, that he might not be miſrepreſented to the King by the Miſtake of the Pen-man, he went away.</p>
               <p>While the Counſellors were pleading, Dr. <hi>Pinfold,</hi> the King's Advocate, ſtood at the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's Elbow and took Notes, by which it was expected that he ſhould make a Reply, but he ſaid nothing; and 'tis ſuppoſed that he ſtaid with the Council, when the Biſhop withdrew, and gave them Reaſons for his ſilence.</p>
               <p>On Monday <hi>Sept.</hi> 6. 1686. There being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Council the ſame as before; and the Biſhop appearing, he was deſired to ſit down, and hear his Sentence, which (to prevent Miſtake) they had ordered to be put in Writing. The Biſhop then would have ſpoke, but was not ſuffered. And then Mr. <hi>Bridgman,</hi> their Regiſter, read the Inſtrument whereby the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was ſuſpended from the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Epiſcopal Office, upon pain of Deprivation, during his Majeſties Pleaſure; ſealed with their Seal, but ſigned by no Body at all.</p>
               <pb n="434" facs="tcp:152694:228"/>
               <p>And ſome day after, one of the Meſſengers attending the Court, delivered to the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> a Warrant from the Eccleſiaſtical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, to cauſe this Sentence to be affixt on the Door of that Chapter-Houſe; and to certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy them of the due Execution hereof. Dated <hi>Septemb.</hi> 28, 1686. and ſealed with the ſame Seal as the Sentence (which was annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) but no Perſons Names. Subſcribed, <hi>To the Dean and Chapter of</hi> London.</p>

                  <hi>Subpoena,</hi> and not to be committed to Priſon; and therefore the Biſhops not being now regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in Court, they ought to be charged with no Informatian, by the expreſs Statute of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the 3d.—The which Objections cauſed a long and learned Debate on both ſides, till at length the Judges over-ruled it; only Mr Juſtice <hi>Powell</hi> refuſed to determine without conſulting Precedents.</p>
               <p>Then the Information againſt the Biſhops was read; the Subſtance whereof was, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the King put out his <hi>Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience</hi> on the 4th of <hi>April</hi> in the 3d Year of his Reign, in which is contained, <hi>&amp;c. [Here that Declaration was inſerted]</hi> and on the 27th of <hi>April</hi> in the 4th Year of his Reign did publiſh his other Declaration, entitled, <hi>&amp;c.

[Here that order of Counſel was inſerted]</hi> After the making of which Order, <hi>viz.</hi> on the 18th of <hi>May</hi> following, at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> the ſeven Biſhops (being here named) did conſult and conſpire among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to diminiſh the Regal Authority, and Royal Prerogative, Power and Government of the King in the Premiſſes, and to infringe and elude the ſaid Older; and in Proſecution and Execution of the Conſpiracy aforeſaid, they the ſaid Biſhops <hi>(here again naming them)</hi> with Force and Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there and then, falſly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:152694:229"/>maliciouſly, ſeditiouſly, and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, did frame, compoſe, and write, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a certain falſe, feigned, malicious, pernicious, and ſeditious Libel in Writing, concerning the King, his Declaration and Order aforeſaid (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of a Petition) then and there ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by them, and in the preſence of the King did publiſh, wherein is contained <hi>[Here the Biſhops Petition was inſerted.]</hi> Whereupon the Attorney General pray'd the Advice of the Court, and due Proceſs of Law to be made out againſt the aforeſaid Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to anſwer to our Lord the King, in and concerning the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes.</p>
               <p>Then the Biſhops Counſel moved for an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parlance</hi> till the next Term, and very learnedly and largely debated with the Kings Counſel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the courſe of the Court as to that Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; but were over-ruled in it. Then the Arch-biſhop in behalf of himſelf and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the other Defendants, tender'd their Plea in writing, which was read, and its Receipt debated; but becauſe it was writ upon Paper, and not upon Parchment, and contained no more than what had been already debated and over-ruled, the Court rejected it; and put them therefore upon it, to plead preſently to the Information; which they all did <hi>Not Guilty;</hi> and this day fortnight appointed for their Trial at this Bar; the Court taking the Biſhops own Recognizance, of the Arch-biſhop in 200 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> and the reſt in 100 <abbr>

                  <p>To whom the Information againſt the Biſhops was read: And then Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> opened the charge: to which Mr. Attorney General ſpoke, ſhewing that the Biſhops were proſecuted not as Biſhops, or for any point of Religion but as Subjects, and for a Temporal Crime. And that alſo they were proſecuted not for omitting any thing, but for doing ſomething, even cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of his Majeſty and Government. The Heinouſneſs of which Crime he opened; and laid down the Method they would proceed in to prove it. And according to the Method ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the Information, that every thing might be proved therein, Mr. Solicitor General order'd to be produced in the Court both the Declarations, under the Great Seal, and the Order of Council for reading the latter, was read out of the Council-Book, and the Printer call'd and ſworn to prove the printing of the Declaration. Then the Biſhops Petition was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in alſo by Sir <hi>John Nicholas,</hi> who being ſworn, depoſed, that he received that Paper from the King in Council the 8th of this Month; that the King had it from him again the 12th; and the 13th he received it again from the King.</p>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:152694:231"/>
                  <p>Then the Court went on to prove the Biſhops hands to it, and for that end Sir <hi>Thomas Exton</hi> was ſworn, who viewing the Paper, depoſed that he did believe it was the Lord Arch-Biſhops Writing, and that his Name was writ there by himſelf; but that he did not know any of the other Names.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> being ſworn, depoſed alſo, that he knew the Arch-biſhop Hand-writing, and (viewing the Paper) did believe that to be written by him. That he knew alſo the Biſhop of St. <hi>Aſaph</hi>'s Writing, and did believe this to be his. That he had ſeen of the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s Writing, and becauſe this did reſemble a Letter that he had by him of his writing to the Biſhop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> therefore he did believe this alſo to be his.—But this was by the Court adjudged to be but weak Evidence. Therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Chetwood</hi> was ſworn to prove the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s Hand, but he only depoſed, That he had a great while ſince, ſeen of what was ſaid to be his Writing, but that he never ſaw him write, and therefore did not certainly know his Hand. And a little after, being called to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s Hands, he ſaid, that he had ſeen of the Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but never ſaw him write his Name, and (looking on his Name) he ſaid he believed that might be his Writing, but he was not certain; that he rather believed it to be his Hand, than that other to be my Lord of <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>After him Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> depoſed (viewing the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s Name) that he had, a good while ſince, ſeen of his Writing, which this did
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:152694:231"/>reſemble, and therefore he believed it might be his Writing; though he could better judg of it when he writ his Name <hi>Turner,</hi> than now it is <hi>Ely,</hi> becauſe there was more Letter to judg by.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Middleton</hi> depoſed to the Arch-Biſhop, and the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> That he had ſeen their Writing, and (upon viewing the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) did believe that this was theirs. That alſo he had my Lord of <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s Writing for ſome Money two Years ago, and he believed this to be like it, but he never ſaw of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but once. That once he ſaw of the Biſhop of <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s Writing alſo, and did think this like it, but could not ſay more.</p>
                  <p>Then Sir <hi>Thomas Pinfold</hi> depoſed to the Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s Writing, that he never ſaw but one Letter from him, and (viewing the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) that he could not tell upon his own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that that was his Hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that he had heard there was a Paper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by my Lords the Biſhops to the King, and this Paper, he ſuppoſing to be the ſame, upon that ſcore he did believe it his Hand, but upon any other ſcore he could not tell what to ſay.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Clavel</hi> was ſworn, who depoſed that he had many times ſeen of the Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s Writing, and believ'd he knew it, and (viewing the Paper) believ'd that to be his Hand; but he could not ſay that ever he had ſeen him write.</p>
                  <p>Next Mr. <hi>James</hi> was ſworn, who depoſed to the Biſhop of <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s Writing, that he believ'd he knew his Hand, but was not certain, becauſe my Lord writ ſeveral times, ſeveral Hands; but
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:152694:232"/>viewing the Paper, he at laſt acknowledg'd that he believ'd this to be his.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Powel</hi> being ſworn, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi>'s writing, that he believed he knew his Hand, but looking upon his Name, ſaid that he did not ſee his Lordſhip write that, but believ'd it to be like his Hand; but would not ſay poſitively that he believ'd it was ſo, becauſe for a Man to ſwear his belief in ſuch a matter, ſeemed to him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thing.</p>
                  <p>Then the Counſel for the King prayed that the Paper might be read; but the Biſhops Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel oppoſed it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Mr. Serj. <hi>Levinz</hi> pleaded, That a Proof by Compariſon of Hands (which was the only Proof they had in this caſe) ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a Criminal Caſe; and becauſe moreover that Compariſon had been proved in ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain manner.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. Serj. <hi>Pemberton</hi> pleaded, that this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence did not amount to ſo much as a Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Hands, becauſe none of them had ever ſeen the Perſons write; and if it did, that was no Evidence in Criminal Caſes.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> pleaded, that it ought to be conſider'd whether Compariſon of Hands be Evidence in a Caſe of Miſdemeanour, (inſtancing in my Lady <hi>Carr</hi>'s Caſe, in <hi>Syderfin</hi>'s <hi>Reports,</hi> where this Court had adjudg'd it otherwiſe;) Or if it be Evidence, whether the Belief of a Man that brings nothing to compare with it, or ever ſaw the Party write, be good Evidence as a Compariſon of Hands?</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. Attorney General reply'd, that this
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:152694:232"/>was Evidence, though not ſo ſtrong, as if they had brought thoſe that had ſeen then write; yet Evidence it was, and whether it were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, that they ſubmitted to the Jury.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. Attorney General prov'd it to be Evidence from <hi>Sydney</hi>'s Caſe, where Evidence upon Compariſon of Hands caſte him. And for the ſame purpoſe Mr. Recorder inſtanced in Sir <hi>Samuel Barnardiſton</hi>'s Caſe, but was preſently fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd by Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer,</hi> who told him that Sir <hi>Samuel</hi> there owned his Hand.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Holloway</hi> then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they thought the Proof too ſlender in this Caſe, for that it ought to be ſtronger in Criminal Matters than in Civil. Therefore the Court being divided, the Ld. Ch. Juſtice told Mr. Sollicitor he muſt go on to ſome other Proof. And then Mr. <hi>Blathwayt</hi> was ſworn, who looking on the Paper, depoſed that he did believe that to be the Paper which the Ld. Arch-Biſhop and the other ſix owned at the Council-Table the 8th of this Month, where when they appeared the firſt time, they were asked if they did own that Paper? they immediately anſwered, that they humbly hoped, as they ſtood there Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, his Majeſty would not take Advantage againſt them, but however they would obey his Majeſty's Command. Thereupon they were commanded to withdraw, which they did. That when they came in the ſecond time, they ſeemed unwilling to own the Paper, ſaying, as they did before, and denying the publiſhing of it. That the third time they attended, they did all own it, and the Arch-Biſhop ſaid it was all written with his own Hand, and that he had not made
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:152694:233"/>uſe of his Clerk; the King not making any Promiſe to them, that no Advantage ſhould be taken, or uſe made of it.—Upon which the Kings Counſel again urged that the Paper might be now read; but the Biſhops Counſel ſtill op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, pleading, that firſt it ought to be proved that this Libel (as they call'd it) was written and publiſhed in <hi>Middleſex;</hi> for that all Matters of Crime were ſo local, that if it be not proved to be done in the County where it is layed, the Party accuſed is as innocent as if he never had done the thing.—But this the Ld. Ch. Juſtice over-ruled, that it was not proper to urge this until the Paper had been read; then Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powel</hi> at firſt oppoſed it. The Biſhops Petition then was read and ſhewn to the Jury: The King's Counſel leaving it here, till they had ſeen what ſhould be ſaid to it. The Biſhops Counſel therefore urged their former Objection, that nothing had been proved to be done in <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex,</hi> and that the Biſhops owning the Paper in that County, would not amount to a Publication of it there; beſides that the Information and Petition did not agree, the Direction and Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary Part being left out.—To which the King's Counſel reply'd, That the Fact being own'd in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> it is to be ſuppoſed to be done there, until they had proved it to be done elſewhere. Which therefore the Biſhops Counſel did by Mr. <hi>Francis Nichols,</hi> who being ſworn, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that he had ſerved the Arch-Biſhop in his Bed-Chamber this ſeven Years, and he was ſure that he never ſtirred out of the Gate of <hi>Lambeth</hi>-houſe, ſince <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt, till the
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:152694:233"/>time he was ſummoned before the Council.</p>
                  <p>Yet Mr. <hi>Finch</hi> inſiſted on it, that the King's Counſel ought to prove the place in which it was writ; for that the Locality of it being part of the Crime as laid in the Information, they had not proved the Charge unleſs they did that; — Which becauſe the King's Counſel could not do, they yielded in that Point; and inſiſted upon the Publication of it in that County, becauſe there it was own'd; inſtancing in ſeveral caſes, wherein the writing of a Libel was adjudged a Publication: To which the Biſhops Counſel reply'd, that in thoſe Caſes it was proved that the Libel was ſent by the Perſons, which here it is not; and till that is proved, it cannot be ſaid to be publiſhed by them, an owning of it to the King and Council, not being criminal; becauſe then an Anſwer to a Queſtion, put by Authority, would be a Crime, and then it would be as if Authority were employed to do wrong. — The King's Counſel therefore inſiſted upon it, that it was their parts to prove it did not come from them to the King, for that the King had it, and they own'd it, and till they proved it otherwiſe, they muſt preſume it was deliver'd by them. — But Preſumption being looked upon as no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the Court would not accept of this. — And therefore the King's Counſel called Mr. <hi>Blathwayt</hi> again, who depoſed (as before) that he was preſent when this Paper was delivered by the King, at the Council-Board, and being asked by Mr. Sollicitor General if there was any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what it was done for, upon the account of Religion, or how? he anſwered, he did hot remember any thing of that <hi>[At which there was
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:152694:234"/>a great Laughter]</hi> — But that he received it from the King's hands, and he knew it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him by the Biſhops, for that he had heard the King ſay ſo ſeveral times. That to the beſt of his remembrance the Biſhops were queſtion'd whether this was the Paper preſented by them to the King; and that he did always think it a plain Caſe that it was ſo, nor did they deny it; but as to that Queſtion, he did not remember what the Words were <hi>[At which there was a great Shout]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Bridgman</hi> was asked the ſame Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; Whether there was any queſtion at the Council-Board, whether this was the Paper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Biſhops to the King? To which he, in anſwer, depoſed that there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about it, but he did not remember whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the queſtion was directly asked or anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; — But he Believed there was no Body doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that that was not the Paper; — And that he ſaw it, ſoon after it was delivered, and heard the King ſay it was the Petition the Biſhops had delivered, and on <hi>Sunday</hi> the King commanded him to copy it, and there was no Copy made of it but that one, notwithſtanding that he ſaw a Copy, within a day or two after it was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, about the Town.</p>
                  <p>Then Sir <hi>John Nicholas</hi> being asked to the ſame Queſtion, anſwered, that (though he was then preſent at the Council-Board) he did not remember that. <hi>[Then there was a great Shout.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Pepy</hi>'s, being ſworn, was examin'd to the ſame; and depos'd that he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any thing was ſpoken about the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, but he believed it was underſtood by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:152694:234"/>Body at the Table, that that was the Paper the Biſhops had delivered.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> being ſworn and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to the ſame, depoſed, that he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ever any ſuch direct Queſtion was asked.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Evidence then the King's Counſel (when they had opened it) ſubmitted to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; And the Ld. Ch. Juſtice began to direct the Jury; but was interrupted by Mr. <hi>Finch,</hi> who queſtioned whether it were Evidence or no; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if it were, they had other matter to offer in Anſwer to this Evidence, and in their own Defence. Whereupon the Ld. Ch. Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to hear them, though the reſt of the Biſhops Counſel pray'd him to go on with his Lordſhips Direction; But juſt as he was begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to go on, the King's Counſel then pray'd his Patience; Mr. Solicitor General, ſaying, There was a Fatality in ſome Cauſes, and ſo there was in this; for that they had notice that a Perſon of very great Quality was coming, that would make it appear, that the Biſhops made their Addreſſes to him, that they might deliver this Paper to the King. — [Then there was 3 or 4 long Pauſes for above half an Hour;] And no one coming, the <hi>Criar</hi> made Oath that Mr. <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam</hi> coming into the Hall when his Lordſhip was directing the Jury, ſaid, my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> was a coming, but he would go and prevent him; And afterwards returning, and finding his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip did not go on, he ſaid he would go again for the Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> whom he had ſent away, and he was now gone for him, and ſaid he would bring him with him preſently. — At length the
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:152694:235"/>Lord Preſident came, and being ſworn, depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, That the Biſhops of Saint <hi>Aſaph</hi> and <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> came to his Office, and told him that they came in the Name of the Archbiſhop and 4 other of their Brethren, <hi>viz.</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Ely, Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells, Briſtol,</hi> and <hi>Peterborough,</hi> to let him know that they had a Petition to deliver to the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he would give them leaver; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know of him, which was the beſt way to do it. That he told them, he would know the King's Pleaſure, and bring them Word again: That they offered him their Petition to read, but he did not think it fit for him to do it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he refuſed and would not read it; but that he went immediately to the King, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Majeſty with it, and he commanded him to let them know they might come when they would, which he immediately did; they ſaid they would go and ſpeak with ſome of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that were not far off; in the mean time he gave order that they ſhould be admitted when they came; and they did in a little time return, and went firſt into the Bed-Chamber, and then into the Room where the King was. And all this was before they appeared at the Council.</p>
                  <p>This was no Evidence, Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> ſaid, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Archbiſhop, becauſe he was not there, and nothing had been proved againſt him as done in <hi>Middleſex;</hi> and for the other 6 Lords, the Lord Preſident did not ſay, that this is the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they ſaid they had to deliver to the King; Nor did he ſee them deliver any thing, but that is ſtill leſt doubtful, ſo that it ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Preſumption, and not upon Proof.—Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Kings Counſel deſired to leave it fairly to
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:152694:235"/>the Jury upon this Fact; and then therefore the Biſhops Counſel deſired to be heard in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. And,</p>
                  <p>Firſt Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer,</hi> in a long and learned Speech, told the Jury that the Charge againſt the Biſhops; was, That they did conſpire to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the Royal Authority, and to this end make a Libel againſt the King: but that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence fell far ſhort of this, which only proved that the Biſhops in as private and humble a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they could, preſented the Paper to the King, which was a Petition to be relieved againſt an Order of Council, which they conceived they were aggrieved by: and herein was no Sedition either in the matter, or manner of delivering it. That it was not to be queſtion'd but that any Subject commanded by the King to do an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thing, or what was againſt his Conſcience, might humbly tell the King why he could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him. And that whereas Mr Attorn. Gen. had at firſt ſaid that the Biſhops were not ſued as Biſhops, nor proſecuted for their Religion; he could not conceive what they were ſued for elſe, the Information being againſt them for an Act they did as Biſhops, and no otherwiſe; it being what was their Duty, and properly within their Sphere and Juriſdiction. — That whether there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they conſider'd the Matter of this Petition, or Manner of delivering it, or the Perſons that deliver'd it, there can appear no Reaſon for ſuch an Information againſt them.</p>
                  <p>In the Matter of the Petition he conſider'd two Things; <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Prayer; wherein he ſhewed there could be nothing of Falſity, nor any thing contrary to Law, for which reaſon he ſaid, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:152694:236"/>it was left out of the Information, as being thought no part of a Libel, and ſo made a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd ſtory of it, without Head or Tail; a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion directed to no Body, and for nothing, it being without both Title and Prayer. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he conſidered the Reaſons of the Biſhops for not complying, expreſſed in it. The firſt whereof is the Declarations of Parliament againſt the Diſpenſing Power; and the next, becauſe it is a Matter of ſo great Moment and Conſequence to the whole Nation, that they could not make themſelves ſo far Parties in it. For if it be of any effect; then by it, not only the Laws of the Reformation, but of all Religion are ſuſpended: and what a miſchief that would be to the Church, which is under the Care of my Lords the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, any one might eaſily apprehend.— [While Sir <hi>Robert</hi> was ſpeaking to theſe things, the Ld. Ch. Juſtice ſaid aſide, that he muſt not ſuffer this. They intended to diſpute the King's Power in ſuſpending Laws. Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powel</hi> reply'd to him, that they could not avoid that Point; becauſe if the King had no ſuch Power, (which was his Judgment) then this Petition could not be Libellous. The Lord Chief Juſtice told him he knew he was full of that Doctrine; and becauſe the Biſhops ſhould have no occaſion to ſay, that he denied to hear their Counſel, he would let them talk on till they were weary.]</p>
                  <p>Then for the <hi>Manner</hi> of delivering the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer</hi> proceeded to ſhew, that from their Evidence it appeared to be in the moſt private and humble manner; Leave being firſt asked, and then given.</p>
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:152694:236"/>
                  <p>Then for the <hi>Perſons,</hi> he ſhewed that they did no more than what was their Duty, and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them; the <hi>Act of</hi> 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. making them ſpecial Guardians of the Law of Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of that other Law in his late Majeſties Reign, where all the Clauſes of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> are revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Now in that Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> there is this Clauſe:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And for the due Execution hereof, the Queen's moſt Excellent Majeſty, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and all the Commons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled, do, in God's Name, earneſtly require and charge all the Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, and other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries, that they do endeavour themſelves, to the utmoſt of their Knowledges, that the due and true execution hereof may be had throughout their Dioceſſes and Charges, as they will anſwer before God, for ſuch Evils and Plagues, wherewith Almighty God may juſtly puniſh his People, for neglecting this good and wholſome Law.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this he ſhewed that it was plain, that the Biſhops, upon pain of bringing upon themſelves the Imprecation of this Act of Parliament, were obliged to ſee it executed; and then when any thing comes under their Knowledg, eſpecially if they are to be Actors in it, that has ſuch a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to deſtroy the very Foundations of the Church, as the Suſpending of Laws has, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them that have no other Remedy, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the King, by Petition, about it; and 'tis the Duty of an Officer or Magiſtrate to tell the King what is Law, and what is not; [he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing in <hi>Cavendiſh</hi>'s Caſe, and another in the
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:152694:237"/>time of the Lord <hi>Hobbart.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Next to him Mr. <hi>Finch</hi> ſpoke, briefly recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the King's Evidence, and then ſhewing that this Petition, as well for the <hi>Matter</hi> of it, as <hi>Manner</hi> of delivering it, and the <hi>Perſons</hi> by whom it was delivered, was no Libel. Particularly that the King's Regal Authority, and Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative was no way diminiſhed thereby; for that the Declaration was founded upon a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Power, which the King could not have; — Becauſe a Power to abrogate Laws, is as much a part of the Legiſlature (which is only in the King and his two Houſes of Parliament) as to make Laws: and a Power to ſuſpend, is equal to a Power of abrogating Laws, becauſe they are no longer in being, as Laws, while they are ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. — That this was never attempted, but in the laſt King's time, which was took notice of, and declared againſt in Parliament, in the Years 1662 and 1672; the effect of which was, that His Majeſty cancell'd the Declaration, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that it ſhould never be drawn into Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Conſequence. — That the Biſhops here, had done but what became them, as Peers and Biſhops, in the moſt decent Manner. And that unleſs this humble Petition, ſo preſented, may be ſaid to be a malicious and ſeditious Libel, with an intent to ſtir up the People to Sedition, the Jury ought not to find my Lords the Biſhops guilty upon that Information.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Pollexfen</hi> next ſpoke, inſiſting upon the Illegality of the King's Declaration, as ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all the Law we have in <hi>England,</hi> almoſt all being Penal Laws, not only thoſe before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, but ſince; eſpecially in matters of
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:152694:237"/>Religion. — And therefore the King's Will, not being conſonant to Law, and not obliging, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done with a more Chriſtian Mind than to inform him of it, by way of Petition, as the Biſhops had done.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. Serjeant <hi>Pemberton</hi> ſpoke; Affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Biſhops had done no more than their Duty, to God, the King, and the Church. — De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Diſpenſing Power, as a thing that ſtrikes at the very Foundation of all the Rights, Liberties and Properties of the Kings Subjects whatſoever. — That the King's Legal Prerogatives are as much for the Advantage of his Subjects, as of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. — That theſe Laws he would by his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuſpend, are the great Bulwark of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion. — Intended to defend the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt falſe Religions, — Particularly the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Religion, (which is the very worſt of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions) a Religion no way tolerable, nor to be endured here. — And yet if this Declaration ſhould take effect, all Religions would be let in, and even that Religion would ſtand upon the ſame terms with the Proteſtant Religion; and all the Care and Statutes that had been againſt it, go for nothing. — That the Biſhops have the Care of the Church, by their very Function and Office; and are bound to take care to keep out all thoſe falſe Religions that are prohibited, and deſigned to be kept out by Law, and therefore could do no leſs than they did. — That our Law did allow the King no ſuch Diſpenſing Power; — Inſtancing in that Check the Parliament had given to it in 1662. — But here the Ld. Ch. Juſtice interrupted him, as being what had been ſpoken to already.</p>
                  <pb n="454" facs="tcp:152694:238"/>
                  <p>Then Mr. Serjeant <hi>Levinz</hi> offered to ſhew, that it has been taken all along, as the ancient Law of <hi>England,</hi> that ſuch Diſpenſations ought to be by the King and Parliament, and not by the King alone: but he was ſtop'd, enough having been offer'd already.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Biſhops Counſel proceeded to prove what had been ſaid; and to that end was produced, and read in Court, the Record of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, wherein the Parliament gave the King a Power to diſpenſe with the Statute of Proviſors (which was a Penal Law, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing collating and preſenting to Dignities and Benefices of the Church) only till the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; declaring withal that it was a <hi>Novelty,</hi> and that it ſhould not be drawn into Example.</p>
                  <p>Then the Journal of the Houſe of Lords was produced, and his Majeſty's Speech to both Houſes, in 1662, read, wherein is this Clauſe; <q>That if the Diſſenters will demean themſelves peaceably and modeſtly under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (his Majeſty ſaid) he could heartily wiſh that he had a Power of Indulgence to uſe upon occaſion.</q> — Whereupon there was a Bill in the Houſe of Lords brought in to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the King to diſpenſe with ſeveral Laws, which was read and committed, but further than that it went not. Which Bill was alſo read out of the Journal.</p>
                  <p>Then the Journal of the Houſe of Commons was produced, and a Vote read, which paſſed, <hi>Feb.</hi> 25. 1662. That no Indulgence be granted to the Diſſenters from the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity:</hi> With the Commons Addreſs, and Reaſons for this Vote; wherein was declared, That the <hi>Act
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:152694:238"/>of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> could not be diſpenſed with, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Act of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The Journal of the Houſe of Lords was again produced, and the King's Speech to both Houſes, on <hi>Feb.</hi> 5. 1672, read, wherein he mentions his Declaration for Indulgence.</p>
                  <p>The Journal then of the Houſe of Commons was again produced; and the Commons Petition and Addreſs to the King, <hi>Feb.</hi> 14. 1672, was read; Wherein they thank him for his Speech, — And tell him, <q>They have conſidered his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration for Indulgence, dated the 15th of <hi>March</hi> laſt; And find themſelves bound in Duty to inform his Majeſty, That Penal Laws in Matters Eccleſiaſtical, cannot be ſuſpended but by Act of Parliament: And do therefore beſeech him, That the ſaid Laws may have their free Courſe, until it ſhall be otherwiſe provided for by Act of Parliament.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then his Majeſty's Anſwer to that Reply was read, wherein he expreſſes his trouble, that his Declaration has diſquieted them; — <q>That he does not pretend to the Right of ſuſpending Laws, wherein the Properties, Rights, or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of any of his Subjects are concerned; nor to alter any thing in the eſtabliſhed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> But his only Deſign in this, was to take off the Penalties and the Statutes inflicted upon Diſſenters. —</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which the Commons replied, (which was then read out of the ſame Journal) <q>That they found his Anſwer not ſufficient to clear the Apprehenſions that may juſtly remain in the Minds of his People, by his Majeſty's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:152694:239"/>claimed a Power to ſuſpend Penal Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes in Matters Eccleſiaſtical; and which his Majeſty does ſtill ſeem to aſſert in his Anſwer, to be intruſted in the Crown, and never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned in the Reigns of any of his Anceſtors: Wherein they humbly conceive him miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; Since no ſuch Power ever was claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or exerciſed by any of his Majeſty's Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors: And if it ſhould be admitted, might tend to the interrupting the free Courſe of the Laws, and altering the Legiſlative Power, which hath always been acknowledged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in his Majeſty, and his two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>With an unanimous Conſent, they therefore again beſought him, <q>That he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give them a full and ſatisfactory Anſwer to their Petition and Addreſs; and take ſuch effectual Order, that the Proceedings in this Matter might not for the future be drawn into Conſequence or Example.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Lords Journal was turned to, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> read, how that the King communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Addreſs to the Lords, and deſired their Advice. And that on <hi>March</hi> the 8th, 1672, He made a Speech to both Houſes; wherein he tells them, <q>That if there was any Scruple remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, concerning the Suſpenſion of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws, he here faithfully promiſed them, That what had been done in that Particular, ſhould not for the future be drawn, either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Conſequence or Example.</q> — After which the Lord Chancellor imparted to them, <q>That his Majeſty found ſome diſſatisfaction remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, concerning the Officers to be employed
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:152694:239"/>abroad; but if that bred any Umbrage, the King commanded him to let them know, That he reſolves to give both his Houſes full Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to their Deſires. — And that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty had, laſt Night, in purſuance of what he then intended, and declared this Morning, concerning the Suſpenſion of Penal Laws, not being for the future to be drawn either into Conſequence or Example, cauſed the Original Declaration under the Great Seal, to be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in his preſence; whereof Himſelf, and ſeveral other Lords of the Council were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</q> — The Record of which in the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was then read.</p>
                  <p>Then his preſent Majeſty's Speech, on <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemb.</hi> 9. 1685, to both Houſes, was read, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, declaring the Neceſſity of his Standing Army, and requiring a Supply for their Maintenance, he ſays, — <q>Let no Man take Exception that there are ſome Officers in the Army not quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied according to the late Teſts,—I will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expoſe them to diſgrace, nor my ſelf to the want of them, if there ſhould be another Rebellion to make them neceſſary to me. —</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Commons Journal being then turned to, their Addreſs to the King was then read; Wherein, after they had thanked him for his Care in the ſuppreſſing the late Rebellion, they acquaint him, that they had conſidered his Speech, and, <q>as to that part of it relating to the Officers, They do, out of their bounden Duty humbly repreſent to him, That thoſe Officers cannot by Law be capable of their Imployments; and that the Incapacities they bring upon themſelves thereby, can no ways
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:152694:240"/>be taken off but by Act of Parliament. — That therefore they are preparing a Bill to indemnify them from the Penalties they have now incurred: And becauſe the continuance of them in their Imployments, may be taken to be a diſpenſing with that Law without Act of Parliament; the Conſequence of which is of the greateſt Concern to the Rights of all his Majeſty's Subjects, and to all the Laws made for the Security of their Religion: They therefore do beſeech him, he would be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to give ſuch Directions therein, that no Apprehenſions or Jealouſies may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Hearts of his Subjects.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this, that forecited Clauſe of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> was read, and then Mr. Serj. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinz</hi> ſpoke to this effect; That the Charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a Libel, it ought to be conſider'd, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Biſhops did deliver this Paper to the King? of which there has been no direct Proof; (Publishing he would not talk of, becauſe there has been no proof of a Publication); or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they did deliver it, Whether this be a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel upon the Matter of it, the Manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering it, or the Perſons that did it? — He ſaid it was no Libel,—taking notice of the diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity offered the Biſhops, in only ſetting forth part, and not the whole.— Affirming, that the Subjects have a Right to Petitioning in all their Grievances; — That this was a Grievance the Biſhops petitioned againſt, it being what the Law, neither Common, nor Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, allowed of; — And therefore the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops could not be guilty of the Charge.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Finch</hi> ſpoke briefly again, making a
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:152694:240"/>Challenge to ſhew any one Inſtance of ſuch a Declaration, ſuch a general Diſpenſation of Laws from the Conqueſt, till 1672. — Leaving their Cauſe upon this Point; That to ſuſpend Laws, is to abrogate them; and that to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Laws is part of the Legiſlature, which Power is lodged in King, Lords, and Commons.</p>
                  <p>To which Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer</hi> added, That he found few Attempts of this Nature in any Kings Reign. In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, there was an Act of Parliament that Foreigners ſhould have a free Trade in <hi>London,</hi> notwithſtanding the Franchiſes of the City. After the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment roſe, the King iſſued out his Proclamation, forbidding the execution of that Law, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that it ſhould be in ſuſpenſe till the next Parliament; yet that was held to be againſt Law. Then he mentioned another Caſe, upon the Statute of 31. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. cap. 8. which enables the King, by Proclamation, in many Caſes, to create the Law; which Statute was repealed by 1. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. cap. 12. That very Act reciting, that the Law is not to be altered, or reſtrained, but by Act of Parliament.—</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Sommers</hi> (of Counſel alſo for the Biſhops) mentioned the Caſe of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Sorrel</hi> upon the Validity of a Diſpenſation of the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, touching ſelling of Wine. Where it was the Opinion of every one of the Judges, and they did lay it down as a ſettled Poſition, that there never could be a Suſpenſion of an Act of Parliament, but by the Legiſlative Power. — Affirming, that the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact alledged in the Biſhops Petition, had been proved perfectly true by the Journals
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:152694:241"/>of both Houſes. That there could be no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign thereby to diminiſh the King's Prerogative, becauſe he had none ſuch; That the Petition could not be <hi>Seditious,</hi> nor ſtir up Sedition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was preſented to the King, in private and alone; <hi>Falſe</hi> it could not be, becauſe the Matter of it is True. There could be nothing of <hi>Malice,</hi> becauſe the Occaſion was not ſought; the Thing was preſſed upon them; and a <hi>Libel</hi> it could not be, becauſe the Intent was innocent, and they kept within the Bounds ſet by the Act of Parliament, that gives the Subject leave to petition his Prince, when he is grieved.</p>
                  <p>Here the Biſhops Counſel ſaying they had done, Mr. Attorn. Gen. ſpoke for the King; Alledging that the Records produced were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, becauſe they were only Matters tranſacted in Parliament, and not Acts of Parliament.—That be their Libel never ſo true, yet ſtill it was Libellous.—That though the Subject may petition the King, yet not in ſuch reflecting Terms. And though Religion was concerned, yet ought not illegal Means he made uſe of;—That therefore the Biſhops ought rather to have acquieſced under their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience till the Parliament met, which the King had promiſed in his Declaration ſhould be in <hi>November.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then Mr. Sol. Gen. in along Speech added, That the Biſhops had no right of Petitioning out of Parliament; and therefore the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Parliament which had been produced were not to the purpoſe. [<hi>Here Mr. Juſtice</hi> Powel <hi>expreſſed his diſlike of this Doctrine aſide to the</hi> Ld. Ch. Juſtice, <hi>who concurred with him.</hi>] Going
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:152694:241"/>on to prove from the Statute 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. that there ought to have been no Complaint made till it had come from the Commons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that the Law continued ſo till the 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. where the Grievance was found, that Offences in the Intervals of Parliament could not be well puniſhed; and then comes the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute that ſets up the Court of Star-Chamber; which yet was aboliſhed by the Statute of the 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 1.—That the Proceedings of Parliament produced were no Declarations of Parliament, (becauſe never paſſed into an Act) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are Nullities, and cannot be accepted of as any Evidence. <hi>[Here again the Ld. Ch. Juſtice, and Mr. Juſtice</hi> Powel <hi>diſcours'd aſide, ſaying, he thought to impoſe upon them, but they believed not one word he ſaid.]</hi> Then he appealed to the Caſe in the 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 2. <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. Where it is aſſerted, That the King may make Orders and Conſtitutions in Matters Eccleſiaſtical.—And the Caſe of <hi>De Libellis Famoſis,</hi> which ſays, in the 5th Report, If a Perſon does a thing that is Libellous, you ſhall not examin the Fact, but the Conſequence.—And therefore if the King hath a Power to make Orders in matters Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, and do ſo; if any bring that Power into Queſtion, that is Sedition; and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality or Illegality of the Order ought not to be examined.—Whence he doubted not but they had here a good Caſe for the King, and that the Jury would give them a Verdict.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. Juſtice <hi>Holloway</hi> asking him, What the Biſhops could have done in this Caſe, if they might not Petition?, he anſwered, That they ſhould have acquieſced till the meeting of
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:152694:242"/>the Parliament <hi>[At which ſome People in the Court hiſſed.]</hi> Adding, that it was one thing for a Man to ſubmit to his Prince, where he cannot obey him, and another thing to affront him; this being Libelling with a Witneſs.</p>
                  <p>To which the Ld. Ch. Juſtice ſaid, That he was of Opinion that the Biſhops might Petition the King, though out of Parliament, but not in ſuch a Reflective manner, becauſe that would make the Government very Precarious.—But Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powel</hi> told Mr. Sol. Gen. it would have been too late to ſtay for a Parliament; and if the Biſhops had diſobeyed without Petitioning, it would have looked like a piece of Sullenneſs, and they would have been blamed for it as much on the other ſide.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Serj. <hi>Baldock</hi> then ſpoke alſo for the King; inſiſting on the Diſobedience of the Biſhops to the King, who is their Supreme Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, they being not commanded to read it themſelves, but only to diſtribute them to be read; and their giving Reaſons for their Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in a Libellous Petition, charging the King with an illegal Act, reflecting upon his Prudence, Juſtice, and Honour, in laying his Commands upon them; which being done by Biſhops, and having an Univerſal influence upon all the People, he left it to his Lordſhip and Jury, whether they ought not to anſwer for it.</p>
                  <p>Then Sir <hi>Barth. Shore</hi> (the Recorder) ſpoke on the ſame Side, ſaying, He thought the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation proved, for that no Anſwer had been made to it; The Anſwer made being but Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative, and taken either from the Perſons of the Defendants, as Peers, (who could have
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:152694:242"/>no right to Petition libellouſly) or from the Form of it's being a Petition, which could no more excuſe them, if it were ſcandellous, than any other. The Author of <hi>Julian the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate</hi> having as much right to publiſh his Book, as the Biſhops had to deliver this Libel to the King. [<hi>For which compariſon he was checked by Mr. Juſtice</hi> Powel, <hi>who told him, it was the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of the Subject to Petition.</hi>] And that it was as lawful for the City of <hi>London</hi> to Petition for the Sitting of a Parliament, as it was for the Biſhops to give Reaſons for their Diſobedience to the King's Command. And if their Petition was reckoned Libellous, in ſaying that what the King had done in Diſſolving the Parliament, was an Obſtruction of Juſtice; what other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction can be made of the Biſhops ſaying, that the King's Declaration is illegal? And if they were ſo ſeverely puniſhed as to loſe their Charter for what they did, the Biſhops ought to have the like Condemnation.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. Serj. <hi>Trinder</hi> ſpoke in defence of the King's Diſpenſing Power; alledging Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hales</hi> Caſe, (which the Ld. Ch. Juſtice told him was beſide the Matter); Then he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the queſtioning of the Biſhops Counſel of the King's Power, by referring themſelves to the Declarations in Parliament, as if the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was under the Suffrages of a Parliament; that yet no ſuch Declaration was produced, they being miſtaken, and therefore it is in the nature of falſe News, which is a Crime for which the Law will puniſh them.</p>
                  <p>Then the Ld. Ch. Juſtice ſumm'd up the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and in concluſion gave his own Opinion, that the Biſhops Petition was a Libel.</p>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:152694:243"/>
                  <p>Then Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powel</hi> gave his Reaſons why he thought it no Libel, and that the King had no Diſpenſing Power.</p>
                  <p>Next Mr. Juſtice <hi>Allybone</hi> endeavoured to make out, and declared his Opinion that it was a Libel. [He refuſed to ſpeak to the Prerogatives of the King, as the Ld. Ch. Juſtice had done before him.] —<hi>Then Wine was ſent for, for the Jury.</hi>—And upon requeſt, they were allowed to have along with them a Copy of the Information, the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Petition, and the Declarations under the Great Seal. But the Journals were not allowed them, Mr. Sollicitor ſaying, they were no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>[Then the Court aroſe, and the Jury went together to conſider of their Verdict, and ſtaid together all Night, without Fire or Candle.]</p>
                  <p>On Saturday, <hi>June</hi> 30. 1688. about Ten of the Clock in the Morning, the Biſhops came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the Court, and immediately after the Jury were brought to the Bar. And their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance being taken, they delivered in their Verdict, <hi>Not Guilty.</hi> [At which there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral great Shouts in the Court, and throughout the Hall.]</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sol. Gen. taking notice of ſome Perſons in the Court that ſhouted, moved very earneſtly that they might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: Whereupon a Gentleman of <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> was laid hold on, but was ſoon after diſcharged. And after the ſhouting was over, the Ld. Ch. Juſtice reproved the Gentleman, ſaying, he was as glad as he could be that the Biſhops were acquitted; but his manner of rejoicing here in Court was indecent; he might rejoice in his Chamber, or elſewhere, and not here.</p>
                  <p>Then asking Mr. Attorny if he had any thing more to ſay to the Biſhops? He ſaid, No.</p>
                  <p>[Then the Court aroſe, and the Biſhops went away.]</p>

               <p>THAT Your Petitioner, after a long and cloſe Impriſonment, was, on the 7th Day of this Month, brought with a Guard of Souldiers into the <hi>Palace-Yard,</hi> upon an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> directed to the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> before any Indictment had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited againſt him: But while he was there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, a Bill was exhibited and found; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was immediately carried to the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> and there Arraigned. In this ſurpriſe, he deſired a Copy of the Indictment, and leave to make his Exceptions, or to put in a Special Plea, and Counſel to frame it; but all was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him. He then offer'd a Special Plea ready ingroſſed, which was alſo rejected without read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and being threatned, That if he did not plead, <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> Judgment of High-Treaſon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152694:244"/>ſhould be entred, he was forced, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law (as he ſuppoſes) to come to a General Iſſue in pleading <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Novemb.</hi> 21. He was brought to his Trial, and the Indictment being ſo perplexed and confuſed, as neither He, nor any of his Friends that heard it, could fully comprehend the Scope of it: He was wholly unprovided of all the Helps that the Law allows to every Man for his Defence: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he did again deſire a Copy, and produced an Authentick Copy of the Statute of the 46 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. whereby it is Enacted, <hi>That every Man ſhall have a Copy of any Record that touches him in any manner, as well that which is for, or againſt the King, or any other Perſon;</hi> but could never obtain a Copy of the Indictment, nor that the Statute ſhould be read. The Jury by which he was tried, was not (as he is informed) ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by the Bailiffs of the ſeveral Hundreds, after the uſual and legal manner, but Names were agreed on by Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> and the Under-Sheriff, and Directions given to the Bailiff to ſummon them; and being all ſo choſen, a Copy of the Pannel was of no uſe to him. When they came to be called, he excepted againſt ſome for being your Majeſty's Servants, which he hoped ſhould not have been returned, when he was proſecuted at your Majeſty's Suit; many others for not being Free-holders: Which Exceptions he thinks were good in Law; and others were lewd and infamous Perſons, not fit to be of any Jury; but all was over-ruled by the Lord Chief Juſtice, and your Petitioner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to challenge them peremptorily, whom he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152694:244"/>found to be picked out, as moſt ſuitable to the Intentions of thoſe who ſought his Ruin; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he loſt the Benefit allowed him by the Law, making his Exceptions, and was forced to admit of Mechanick Perſons, utterly unable to judg of ſuch a Matter as was to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. This Jury being ſworn, no Witneſs was produced, who fixed any Thing beyond Hear-ſay upon your Petitioner, except the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> and them that ſwore to ſome Papers ſaid to be found in his Houſe, and offered as a ſecond Witneſs, and written in a Hand like to that of your Petitioner.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner produced Ten Witneſſes, moſt, of them Men of Eminent Quality, the others of Unblemiſhed Fame, to ſhew the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Teſtimony was inconſiſtent with what he had ſworn before at the Trial of the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and declared under the ſame Religious Obligation of an Oath, as if it had been legally adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner did further; endeavour to ſhew, That beſides the Abſurdity and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of his Teſtimony, he being guilty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Crimes, which he did not pretend your Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had any knowledg of; and having no other hope of Pardon, but by the <hi>Drudgery of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> againſt him, he deſerved not to be believed: And ſimilitude of Hands could be no Evidence, as was declared by the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Keel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and the whole Court, in the Lady <hi>Carr</hi>'s Caſe; ſo as that no Evidence remained againſt him.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:152694:245"/>
               <p>But whoſoever wrote thoſe Papers, they were but a ſmall Part of a Polemical Diſcourſe, in Anſwer to a Book written about thirty Years ago, upon General Propoſitions applied to no Time, or any particular Caſe; ſo that it was impoſſible to judg of any Part of it, unleſs the Whole did appear, which did not, the ſenſe of ſuch Parts as were not produced, could not be comprehended, unleſs the Whole had been read, which, was deny'd. The Ink and Paper ſhewed them to be written many Years ago; the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> not knowing of them, they could have no concurrence with what your Petitioner is ſaid to have deſigned with him and others; the Confuſion and Errors in the Writing, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they had never been ſo much as review'd, and being written in a Hand that no Man could eaſily read, they were never fit for the Preſs, nor could be in ſome Years, though the Writer of them did intend it, which did not appear; but they being the only preſent crude and private Thoughts of a Man, for the exerciſe of his own. Underſtanding in his Studies, and never ſhewed to any, or applied to any particular Caſe, could not fall under the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which takes Cognizance of no ſuch Matter, and could not by conſtruction be brought under it, ſuch Matters being thereby reſerved to the Parliament, and is declared in the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> which he deſired might be read, but was refuſed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Important Points of Law did hereupon emerge, upon which your Petitioner knowing his own Weakneſs, did deſire that Counſel might be heard, or it might be reſerved to be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152694:245"/>found eſpecial; but all was over-ruled by the Violence of the Lord Chief Juſtice, and your Petitioner ſo frequently interrupted, that the whole Method of his, Defence was broken, and he not ſuffered to ſay the tenth Part of what he could have alledged in his Defence; ſo the Jury was hurried into a Verdict which they did not underſtand.</p>
               <p>Now, foraſmuch as no Man that is oppreſſed <hi>England,</hi> can have Relief, unleſs it be from your Majeſty? your Petitioner humbly prays, that the Premiſſes conſidered, your Majeſty would be pleaſed to admit him into your Preſence; and if he doth not ſhew that it is for your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Honour and Intereſt to preſerve him from this ſad Oppreſſion, he will not complain though he be left to be deſtroyed.</p>

               <p>To whom the Indictment being read, Mr. <hi>Phips</hi> (Counſel for the King) opened the Caſe, and was ſeconded by Mr. Serjeant <hi>Selby,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charles Moloy.</hi>

               <p>Then <hi>Joſias Keeling,</hi> being called and ſworn, depoſed, in general, concerning his being at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Meetings, wherein the Methods had been propoſed about an Inſurrection, and that the Priſoner was looked upon as a Perſon fitting to manage one Diviſion in order thereto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but could not particularly charge him with any thing upon his own knowledg.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Lee</hi> depoſed, that Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> told him, The Priſoner was to manage one Diviſion; and going to him about it from Mr. <hi>Goodenough,</hi> he plainly perceiv'd he was no ſtranger to it, nor bogled to give his Aſſent, and ſeemed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſirous to ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Goodenough</hi> about it. That going one day with the Priſoner to the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Houſe, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, after he had had ſome Diſcourſe with one of the Duke's Servants, came to him and told him, the Duke was willing to engage in the Buſineſs, and aſſur'd him that he had divers Horſes kept in the Country, to be in a readineſs when Matters ſhould come to Extremity. That from thence going with him to the King's-Head Tavern, they had Diſcourſe to the ſame effect there. That from thence to the Devil-Tavern, where the Priſoner propoſed the ſeizing the <hi>City, Tower, Savoy, White-Hall,</hi> and the Perſon of the late King, and promiſed not to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein. That at another time, meeting him at the Half-Moon Tavern in <hi>Alderſgate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> (the deſign of all which Meetings, was upon the account of carrying on the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) and diſcourſing about the Condition the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152694:247"/>Conſpirators were in. As to the intended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, he ſaid, <hi>If he could but ſee a Cloud at big as a Man's Hand, he would not be wanting to employ his Intereſt.</hi> That the Priſoner alſo had told him, that he intended to take an Houſe near the <hi>Tower,</hi> to place Men in, in order to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize it; to that end he held correſpondence with ſome Sea-Captains, and that he had been with them at Coffee-Houſes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Goodenough</hi> depoſed, That being in company with the Priſoner, he had heard him approve of the Deſign, and promiſe to uſe his Intereſt in raiſing Men; and not only to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the Diviſion allotted him, but in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing the <hi>City, Savoy,</hi> &amp;c. and in driving the Guards out of Town.</p>
               <p>Then the Priſoner called ſeveral Witneſſes to invalidate <hi>Lee</hi>'s Teſtimony. Sir <hi>Robert Adams</hi> teſtified to a falſe Report of his, about beating three Knights. Sir <hi>Simon Lewis</hi> was called to the ſame purpoſe, but appeared not. <hi>James Child</hi> could ſay nothing, but that <hi>Lee</hi> was an Honeſt Man. One <hi>Baker</hi> was alſo call'd, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify that <hi>Lee</hi> would have ſuborned him againſt the Priſoner to his Prejudice, ſome Years ſince, of which he had made Affidavit before Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Turner:</hi> But <hi>Baker</hi> not appearing, Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Turner</hi> was deſired to give account of it; but it being above two Years ſince, he could not remember ſuch Particulars: His Clerk, Mr. <hi>Tomkins</hi> remembred ſuch an Affidavit was made in 1682, which mention'd Mr. <hi>Lee;</hi> but to the beſt of his remembrance, it was returned
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152694:247"/>before the King and Council, and he could not give any account of the Particulars.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bateman</hi> then deſiring to know upon what Statute he was Indicted, and (being aſſiſted by his Son, by reaſon of his Incapacity) making little more Defence, the Ld. Ch. Juſtice of the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> ſumm'd up the Evidence; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priſoners were tried: and juſt before the Jury went out, the aforeſaid <hi>Baker</hi> being found, with much ado it was obtain'd, that he ſhould give in his Evidence; which was, That <hi>Lee</hi> perſwaded him to intrude himſelf into the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner's Company, and ſome others, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of State-Affairs, by which means he would find a way to make him a Man; of which he had made Affidavit before Sir <hi>William Turner.</hi> But this the Court interpreted to <hi>Lee</hi>'s Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as if he only thereby deſigned to make a diſcovery of the Plot, and ſo have got a further Evidence to corroborate his own; reflecting on <hi>Baker</hi> as a broken Fellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After which the Jury withdrawing for half an hour, brought the Priſoner in <hi>Guilty.</hi> And accordingly he being brought again to the Bar, on Friday following, Mr. Recorder ſentenc'd him to be <hi>Drawu, Hang'd,</hi> and <hi>Quarter'd;</hi> which was executed upon him at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> on Friday, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 18th following.</p>

               <p>THen and there the Priſoner appearing, and the grand Jury for the County of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> call'd over, his Indictment was read; which was for <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> in conſpiring the Death of the late King, and raiſing a Rebellion in this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>To which (before Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> pleaded) he intimated his having been tried for the ſame Fact above two Years ago; and withal, gave the Lord Chief Juſtice to underſtand, that he thought he had as much to ſay, in Point of Law, for himſelf, as any Priſoner that ever came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; but that he was reſolved to paſs by all Pleas whatſoever, and caſt himſelf wholly upon the King's Mercy.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice told him, his former Indictment was for <hi>High-Miſdemeanour,</hi> but this for <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> and therefore a different Fact, requiring him therefore to plead.</p>
               <p>Then he pleaded <hi>Guilty</hi> to the Indictment, requeſting his Lordſhip's Interceſſion for him with the King: Which was readily enough
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152694:248"/>granted; and the Method he was perſwaded to take highly approved, as anſwering the Deſign of giving Life and Credit to the <hi>Fanatick Rlot,</hi> and gratifying the Importunity (poſſibly) of ſome Great Ones.</p>
               <p>However, the diſmal Sentence of Death was by Mr. Recorder, pronounced upon him, due to <hi>High-Treaſon;</hi> yet not without a ſhew of Tenderneſs, and ſome encouragement of an Obligation this brave Perſon had hereby meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them; This getting a Pardon, when nothing elſe muſt.</p>
